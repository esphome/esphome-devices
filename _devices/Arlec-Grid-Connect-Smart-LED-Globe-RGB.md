The [Arlec Smart LED Globe RGB B22 (GLD120HA)](https://www.bunnings.com.au/arlec-smart-9w-806lm-rgb-cct-bc-globe-with-grid-connect_p0111500) 
bulb, which is part of the [Grid Connect ecosystem](https://grid-connect.com.au/) and is sold at Bunnings in Australia and New Zealand, can be flashed using tuya-convert.  Its configuration is identical to the [Lonsonho 9W E27 RGBWW](/devices/Lonsonho-9W-E27-RGBWW-bulb/) bulb; see that page for configuration and instructions.

The E27 model (GLD122HA) is most likely the same, but this has not been verified/tested.
