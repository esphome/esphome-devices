## Flashing

As of November 2024, there are two methods of flashing this device, using a serial adapter and ltchiptool, or OTA using tuya-cloudcutterflash

### OTA

CAUTION: either install the device properly in the wall before attempting, or have another way of safely powering the device. OTA flashing when the device is powered with mains current can be dangerous

Newer versions of this switch use the BK7231N chip, running 1.0.1 firmware. These devices are able to be flashed using tuya-cloudcutter.

Install Tuya-cloudcutter, following instructions [here](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter/tree/main/custom-firmware)

Once the tool is installed, run it with this command:

```sudo ./tuya-cloudcutter.sh -p gosund-sw5-a-v2.1-smart-switch-bk7231n-v1.0.1 -f ESPHome-Kickstart-v23.08.29_bk7231n_app.ota.ug.bin```

FOllow the onscreen instructions to put the device into "slow blink" mode, and then power off/back on when prompted. This will install the ESPHome Kickstart firmware. From there is is possible to OTA install full ESPHome.

### Serial

The newer versions off amazon US (2024+) of this device came with a Beken BK7231N chip

For newer devices, use a USB to serial adapter, and solder wires onto the pads marked TX, RX, 3.3V and GND.
If you have the stock firmware on the device, you can hold the button for 5 seconds to reset it to get itchiptool to
work.

build the firmware in esphome and flash it using the itchiptool

download the firmware in the uf2 format

Install itchiptool from [here](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ltchiptool)

figure out the serial port the device is connected to and run the following command
(in my case it was /dev/ttyUSB0 in linux, but in windows it will be a com port)

run the following command to flash the firmware
`ltchiptool flash write -d /dev/ttyUSB0 YOUR_FIRMWARE_FILE.uf2`

you will see an output like this:

```text
I: Detected file type: UF2 - esphome 2023.11.6

I:     --------+        +--------------------
I:
I: Using a good, stable 3.3V power supply is crucial. Most flashing issues
I: are caused by either voltage drops during intensive flash operations,
I: or bad/loose wires.
I:
I: The UART adapter's 3.3V power regulator is usually not enough. Instead,
I: a regulated bench power supply, or a linear 1117-type regulator is recommended.
I:
I: To enter download mode, the chip has to be rebooted while the flashing program
I: is trying to establish communication.
I: In order to do that, you need to bridge CEN pin to GND with a wire.
```

Power cycle the device by removing the 3.3v

> Don't disconnect the usb/serial converter just remove 3.3v to the device to power cycle it

When it turns back on it will be in download mode and you should see something similar to this:

```text

Congrats you are done! You can now disconnect it and wire in the normal switch!

## Notes/Issues/Troubleshooting

Use an external 3.3v power supply, the onboard regulator is not enough to power the device and flash.

There are at least 2 versions of this device and I found photos with the bk7231t they are not compatible, you need to
build the firmware for the correct chip. I know because I was scratching my head until I actually took a photo and
confirmed the chip on my board

- Here is the amazon link to the device I bought: [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JZ6W1BH)
  - Good as of Sept 2024
- This is an exact teardown of the device (with the other
  controller) [Teardown](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3892160.html)
- I designed and 3d printed a pogo based clip to flash the device here is
