## DDS238-4 W and DTS238-7 W Wifi Energy Meters

The `dxs238xw` component allows full use of all the functions of the DDS238-4 W and DTS238-7 W Wifi energy meters. The `dxs238xw` component together with ESPHome is a good replacement for the original firmware of these meters and allows a perfect integration with Home Assistant.

## Flashing info

The installation of this component in your energy meter necessarily requires opening the meter, desoldering the ESP8266 module and installing the new firmware. Then solder the ESP8266 module again and test its operation.

Subsequent updates no longer require disarming the energy meter again, as they are done over OTA.

Because it is necessary to desolder the ESP8266 module, minimal knowledge of electronics is required.

It is convenient before installing the new firmware, make a backup copy of the original firmware.

This development works only with the meters that work with the WISEN app. If your meter is TUYA, this solution is not for you.

## Actions

Three actions related to the change of state of the energy meter have been configured.

### `dxs238xw.meter_state_on` Action

This action change the state of the energy meter to On.

```yaml
    on_...:
      then:
        - dxs238xw.meter_state_on
```

This action can also be expressed in [lambdas](https://esphome.io/guides/automations.html#config-lambda):

```yaml
    id(smart_meter).meter_state_on();
```

### `dxs238xw.meter_state_off` Action

This action change the state of the energy meter to Off.

```yaml
    on_...:
      then:
        - dxs238xw.meter_state_off
```

This action can also be expressed in [lambdas](https://esphome.io/guides/automations.html#config-lambda):

```yaml
    id(smart_meter).meter_state_off();
```

### `dxs238xw.meter_state_toggle` Action

This action toggle the state of the energy meter between on off.

```yaml
    on_...:
      then:
        - dxs238xw.meter_state_toggle
```

This action can also be expressed in [lambdas](https://esphome.io/guides/automations.html#config-lambda):

```yaml
    id(smart_meter).meter_state_toggle();
```

### Actions For the Buttons in the Meter

The meter has 2 physical buttons, but only the physical button that configures the Wifi can be modified. For the button that switches between the measured values, it is not possible to change its behavior.

The following code is just a proposal that modifies the original behavior of the button that configures the Wifi, for a new behavior that activates or deactivates the internal relay of the meter. Feel free to configure the behavior of the buttons however you like. [Binary Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/binary_sensor/)

```yaml
    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        internal: true
        id: button_0
        pin:
          number: GPIO13
          mode:
            input: true
            pullup: true
          inverted: true
        on_multi_click:
        - timing:
            - ON for at least 1s
          then:
            - dxs238xw.meter_state_toggle
          invalid_cooldown: 0ms
```

### Actions For the Status Led in the Meter

For the status led present on the meter, it must be configured with the following code. This configuration connects the led on the meter with the EspHome status control. [Status Led](https://esphome.io/components/status_led)

```yaml
    status_led:
      pin:
        number: GPIO14
        inverted: no
```

## UART Connection for update firmware

Communication with the energy meters is through [UART](https://esphome.io/components/uart.html). The following image shows the internal ESP8266 module in the energy meter, and its connections.

## Add External Component in ESPHome

Until the pull request is accepted, and since this component (`dxs238xw`) is not native to ESPHome, you must integrate it in the following way in the code editor. [External Component](https://esphome.io/components/external_components)
Afterwards it should be merged into the main branch.

```yaml
external_components:
   - source:
       type: git
       url: https://github.com/rodgon81/esphome
       ref: dev
     refresh: 300s
     components: [ dxs238xw ]
```
