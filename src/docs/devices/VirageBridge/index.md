## General Notes

The VirageBridge 433 MHz to WiFi Bridge (based on a Sonoff RF Bridge) runs a customized version of Tasmota optimized for receiving signals from sensors such as door contacts and motion sensors.

It ships with a USB power supply and cord, and is optimized for Home Assistant, Domoticz and OpenHab. You can easily upload an ESPHome binary using the Firmware Upgrade function in the built-in web interface.
