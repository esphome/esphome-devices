## Dewenwils Heavy Duty 40A Outdoor Plug (HOWT01A & TM-050B)

The device has 2 indicator LEDs, 1 power button, 1 reset button and 1 controllable  double pole relay.
The device is controlled by a ESP8266 that is from ECO-PLUGS, and the [FCC filing](https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/PAGECO-PLUGS) can be found here.
The device uses a Proprietary app that cannot be flashed to ESPHome OTA, the initial install must be USB to Serial. Once ESPHome is installed all future downloads can be OTA.

## GPIO Pinout

The GPIO pinout was learned from [NorthernMan54](https://gist.github.com/NorthernMan54/ef912a07482b9ab83fa80b91b5b763e8) and [Tasmota](https://templates.blakadder.com/dewenwils_HOWT01A.html) documentation.

The GPIOs being used are:

* Button: GPIO13
* Relay1: GPIO15
* Blue LED: GPIO02

## Enter Flash Mode

In order to get the ESP chip into flash mode I did the following:
Hold GPIO0 to ground, then apply power. My connections were soldered, so I left GPIO0 connected to ground for the duration of the flash.
Once log showed a successful flash I removed the GPIO0, TX and RX pins and rebooted device.
