## Initial Install

The device does not appear to be compatible with tuya-cloudcutter.
There is a small recessed clip in each corner of the plug that will require prying.
This will reveal the PCB which has the neutral and live pins soldered through it and a BK7231N chip.
Unsoldering these pins will allow you to remove the PCB which reveals test pads for VCC, GND, CEN, TX1, and RX1 on the underside.
