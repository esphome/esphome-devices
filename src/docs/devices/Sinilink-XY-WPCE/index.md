title: Sinilink PCIe Computer Remote (XY-WPCE)
date-published: 2022-10-22
type: misc
standard: global
---

A simple remote control/monitor device for use with standard PCs.

Essentially a proxy between the power switch and motherboard.
Depending on the version, the module may also be wired between the power LED(s) to discern the power status (running/off/sleep) of the PC.

The `WPCE` version (this device) determines the power status via the normal/aux 3v3 rails on the PCI-Express slot so it does not feature the power led connections.

## Flashing

The module uses `1mm` pitch headers which are considerably smaller and fussier to deal with relative to the `2.54mm` pitch headers that are more common.
You don't _have_ to solder wires to program, though.
I was able to strip some **solid core** cat5 cables; the bare copper wire was _precisely_ the right size to fit inside of the hole.

| GND       | Ground         | If using a dedicated power supply with the USB programmer, make sure that the GND for the programmer and power supply are linked! |

Connect all 6 pins as indicated and _then_ power up the device and _then_ plug in the USB programmer.
The module should immediately enter boot loader mode and should be "discoverable" with `esptool.py`.

While not strictly necessary, you may wish to backup the flash content before overwriting with ESPHome.

```shell
# Confirm that you can "see" the module
❯ esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 chip_id

# Double check the type/size of the flash chip
❯ esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 flash_id

# Read out the flash; in this case, the `flash_id` command indicated that the ESP had 2MB of built in flash memory
❯ esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 read_flash 0x000000 0x200000 flash_backup.bin
```

## Basic Configuration

The configuration below covers just the basics for getting the various GPIO pins configured / usable in ESPHome.
Depending on your specific needs, more configuration will likely be needed.
E.G.: most motherboards will interpret the power button being pressed for 5+ seconds to mean "shutdown _now_". Exposing `GPIO5` to Home Assistant _directly_ as a gpio switch may result in the PC powering off a few seconds after it's powered on.

```yaml
substitutions:
  friendly_name: "My PC Power Control"
  friendly_name_short: "My PC"

  hostname: "my-pc-power-remote-control"

esphome:
