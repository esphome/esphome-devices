![Seal](../Shelly-Plug-S-Gen3/seal(plombe).jpeg "Seal")
This little seal need to drill open, best you use a prick punch with an M3.5-M4 Drill.
When the seal is cracked open, you need a M2 drill, and drill in center, just a little.
Now take a tapered punch and press the seal out. The whole grounding receptacle will come out.

Now we need some hot-air (~300Â°C) and 5 of the iFixit triangle-plastic, there are 3 spots with glue.
Heat them up, and try placeing the plastic around.
You will get a little gap, take anohter plastic and g et betweet the withe and transparent plastic, and make a circle.

After 2 rounds you can easly take it out.

thx to bkbartk for the picutre <3
