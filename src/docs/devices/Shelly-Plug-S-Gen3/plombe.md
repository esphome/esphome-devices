![Seal](../Shelly-Plug-S-Gen3/seal(plombe).jpeg "Seal") 
This little seal need to drill open, best you use a prick punch with an M3.5-M4 Drill. When the seal is cracked open, you need a M2 drill, and drill in center, just a little. Now take a tapered punch and press the seal out. The whole grounding receptacle will come out. 


Now we need some hot-air (~300Â°C) and 5 of the iFixit triangle-plastic. There are 3 spots with glue. Heat them up, and try placeing the plastic around. You will get a little gap, take anohter plastic and get betweet the withe and transparent plastic, and make a circle. after 2 rounds you can easly take it out.
