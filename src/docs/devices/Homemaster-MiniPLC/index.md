# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This section configures the relays (output switches) and buzzer connected to the I/O
# expanders (PCF8574) and other GPIO pins on the ESP32.
#
# **Switch Relays**:
# - Each relay is configured with a specific name and a GPIO pin on the expander to control its state:
#   - **Relay #1**: Connected to `pcf8574_hub_b`, pin number 2 (inverted logic: LOW to activate).
#   - **Relay #2**: Connected to `pcf8574_hub_b`, pin number 1 (inverted logic: LOW to activate).
#   - **Relay #3**: Connected to `pcf8574_hub_b`, pin number 0 (inverted logic: LOW to activate).
#   - **Relay #4**: Connected to `pcf8574_hub_a`, pin number 6 (inverted logic: LOW to activate).
#   - **Relay #5**: Connected to `pcf8574_hub_a`, pin number 5 (inverted logic: LOW to activate).
#   - **Relay #6**: Connected to `pcf8574_hub_a`, pin number 4 (inverted logic: LOW to activate).

# **LEDs (User-configurable)**:
# - **LED #2**: Connected to `pcf8574_hub_b`, pin number 3 (inverted logic: LOW to turn on).
# - **LED #3**: Connected to `pcf8574_hub_b`, pin number 4 (inverted logic: LOW to turn on).
# - The LEDs are **not** tied to relay status, but are instead **user-configurable** and can be used for
#   any purpose that the user requires, such as indicators, feedback lights, or status lamps for other system conditions.
# - The user can assign logic for turning the LEDs on or off based on specific requirements, such as device status or manual control.
# - The LEDs are connected to the I/O expander and can be turned on or off by controlling their respective GPIO pins.

# **Buzzer**:
# - The buzzer provides an audible notification or alarm when triggered.
# - The buzzer is connected to **GPIO02** through an **LEDC output** (Pulse Width Modulation - PWM).
# - The buzzer is controlled using a **template switch** to turn it on or off.
# - When turned on, the buzzer emits a tone at a frequency of **2441Hz** at **75% volume**.
# - The buzzer is used to signal important events or alarms in the system, such as errors, notifications, or alerts.

# **Switches (Relays and LEDs)**:
# The switches and relays are controlled through the **GPIO pins** and the **I/O expander**:
