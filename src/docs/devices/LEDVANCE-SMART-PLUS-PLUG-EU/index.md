title: LEDVANCE SMART PLUS PLUG EU
date-published: 2024-03-31
type: plug
standard: eu
board: bk72xx
---
LEDVANCE SMART PLUS PLUG EU based on BK7231T chip (WB2S).
Can be flashed with esphome kickstart via tuya-cloudcutter.
On publish date you need to use ESP-Home beta to build bk72xx targets.
voltage_divider and current_resistor are estimated.
