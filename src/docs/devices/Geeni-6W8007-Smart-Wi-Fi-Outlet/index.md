## General Notes

Model Reference: 6W8007

Manufacturer: [Geeni](https://mygeeni.com/)

The Geeni Smart Wi-Fi Outlet is available at Amazon and is also available as a 2-pack.

This plug is not able to be converted with tuya-convert as of May 2024. You will need to disassemble and flash with a USB to Serial adapter. The pins are easily accessible once the device is disassembled.

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin    | Function              |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| P6     | Relay 1               |
| P7     | Relay 2               |
| P24    | Button                |
| P26    | Blue LED (inverted)   |

## Disassembly Guide

1) Unscrew back cover with Qty. 4 - Phillips #1 screws - note: loosen the 2 terminal screws for hot/neutral but don't remove. They'll stay in place for reassembly. Don't take them all the way out like I did

2) Separate outlet into 2 parts

3) Separate back half (black plastic) by prying the insert holding the chips

4) Access CB2S for flashing. I placed it in a small vise to hold vertical and used needle probes to flash the chip, then reassembled in reverse order.
