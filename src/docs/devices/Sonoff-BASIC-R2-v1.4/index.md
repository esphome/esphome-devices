title: Sonoff BASIC R2 v1.4
date-published: 2020-11-22
type: relay
standard: global
board: esp8266
---

v1.4 differs from the previous iterations of the Sonoff BASIC in that the two colour LED
is blue and red (opposed to green and red).

This configuration is setup so that when the relay is manually activated via the button
both the blue and red LED are lit (making the LED colour output purple). If the relay
is activated via other means (such as Home Assistant) then it will simply be lit red.

The red side of the LED cannot be individually controlled without modification to the hardware

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin    | Function                           |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| GPIO0  | Push Button (HIGH = off, LOW = on) |
| GPIO12 | Relay and its status LED           |
| GPIO13 | Blue LED (HIGH = off, LOW = on)    |
| GPIO3  | RX pin (for external sensors)      |
| GPIO1  | TX pin (for external sensors)      |
