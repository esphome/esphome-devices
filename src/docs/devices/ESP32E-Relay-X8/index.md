## Product description

This is a 8-relay board with an ESP32-WROOM-E.

Each relay has COM+NO+NC exposed. Product descriptions don't seem to specify maximum load. Each relay supports 10Amp max load, acconding to the label.

The board can be powered either via 7-30VDC or via 5VDC (separate connectors). It draws about 100mA with the relays off, and just over 500mA with all the relays on.

I bought it from: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802045374301.html

## GPIO Pinout

This board has headers for every GPIO pin on its ESP32.
