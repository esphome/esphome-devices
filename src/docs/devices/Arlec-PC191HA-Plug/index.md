The Arlec PC191HA power plug is part of the [Grid Connect ecosystem](https://grid-connect.com.au/) and is sold at Bunnings in Australia and New Zealand.  
These are available in White (PC191HA) or Black (PC191BKHA), and in 4-packs of White and Black - which are identical.  
It is compact, easily fitting side-by-side in double wall sockets.  

The Arlec Grid Connect Smart Plug In Socket With Energy Meter uses a WB2S module with BK7231T chip (a variant of bk72xx) and is supplied with Tuya firmware.  
As at the time of writing, they can be flashed without disassembly or soldering [using cloudcutter](#Using-Cloudcutter).  

NOTE: apparently from approx. May 2023 Bunning is now selling "series 2" units, which use a CB2S module.  

Bunnings also have similar-looking Arlec Grid Connect variations:
     - PC192HA with USB,
     - PCTH01HA with Temperature And Humidity Sensor,
     - PC287HA Twin Socket with Energy Meter and Surge Protection,
     - PC193HA Multi-Function Socket With USB
I have NOT looked at any of these variations to find out if they are similar to PC191HA.  

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin | Function                             |
| --- | ------------------------------------ |
| P6  | (PWM0) Relay                         |
| P7  | (PWM1) BL0937 CF pin                 |
| P8  | (PWM2) BL0937 CF1 pin                |
| P24 | (PWM4) BL0937 SEL pin                |
| P26 | (PWM5) LED                           |
| P10 | (RXD1) Wifi LED (hidden inside unit) |
| P11 | (TXD1) Button                        |

## Getting it up and running

### Using Cloudcutter

Cloudcutter is a tool that simplifies flashing Tuya-based devices. It allows you to flash the firmware remotely, eliminating the need to physically open the device. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter) to flash your Arlec PC1914HA device using Cloudcutter.  
After that, you can use ESPHome's OTA functionality to make any further changes.  

### Note on Power Monitoring

Power measurement uses the BL0937 chip, which is similar to HLW8012 except CF and CF1 are inverted.  
I found that setting current_resistor to give an accurate Amperage does NOT also give the correct Wattage, so instead I calculate current from power and voltage.

# PC191HA basic switch operation - button, relay and LED
#
    # button is momentary on - shows "on" in HA except for the moment the button is being pressed
    # LED should have same on/off state as the relay.  
    # there is also a wifi_LED, but it is not seen from outside the case

    # PC191HA includes a BL0937 chip for measuring power consumption
    #     and BL0937 is a variation of hlw8012, but using inverted SEL pin functionality
  - platform: hlw8012

    sel_pin:          # I believe that cf_pin reports either Voltage or Current depending on this select pin

      inverted: true  # the logic of BL0937 is opposite from HLW8012
      number: P8

    update_interval: 15      # How often to measure and report values

    # PC191HA measures and returns Voltage OR Current according to the value of sel_pin,  
    #   but it can change the value of sel_pin periodically
    initial_mode: "VOLTAGE"       # reports VOLTAGE or CURRENT
    change_mode_every: 4          # how many times to report before swapping between
        #   reporting Voltage or Current. Note that the first value reported should be ignored as inaccurate

    # Adjust according to the actual resistor values on board to calibrate the specific unit
    voltage_divider:  775     # LOWER VALUE GIVES LOWER VOLTAGE
    current_resistor: 0.0009  # HIGHER VALUE GIVES LOWER WATTAGE
