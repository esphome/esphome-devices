## General Notes

This devices has a CB3S board. It can be bought at Aliexpress, e.g. [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007804859733.html) (February 2025).

Despite appearing outwardly identical to the [Tuya Generic IRC03 IR Blaster](/devices/Tuya-Generic-IRC03-IR-Blaster), the IRC03 has a custom PCB with the BK7231N directly integrated into it as opposed to using the CB3S module. The pinouts between the two devices differ as a result.
