## Vaiotech KW 600 Rowi2

This project is the home of the [ESPHome][esphome] firmware for the [Vaiotech KW600][vaiotech].

![Vaiotech KW600](./docs/rowi2.png)

> **Note:**
> If you intend to integrate your device with Home Assistant, please ensure you order the **ESPHome firmware** version
> of Rowi2. The default firmware does **not** support Home Assistant integration.

Rowi2 is available in two different versions:

- **Default Rowi firmware:** Local REST API & MQTT integration
- **ESPHome firmware:** For Home Assistant and custom automation

There are two external sensors available:

- Temperature and Humidity
- Temperature, Humidity, and Air Quality

Details and technical specs: [Rowi2 Specifications][vaiotech-tech].

## ESPHome Firmware Features

- Onboard device to Home Assistant using [Improv-BLE][onboarding]
- **Bluetooth proxy:** Acts as a BLE proxy to relay Bluetooth Low Energy devices to Home Assistant
- Temperature and humidity offset
- Option to calibrate voltage, current, power, and energy
- Factory reset device by pressing button for over 10 seconds
- **Automatic firmware updates:** The ESPHome factory firmware supports auto-update for new releases

## LED Status & Light Modes

The RGB LED on the Rowi2 device indicates the current state:

| State | Color / Effect | Description |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Improv BLE (Onboarding)** | Aqua, Fast Pulse | Device is in onboarding mode |
| **Initialization (WiFi connected)** | Solid White | Device is initializing, WiFi connected |
| **Initialization (WiFi not connected)**| Magenta, Slow Pulse | Device is initializing, WiFi not connected |
| **No Home Assistant Connection** | Red, Asymmetrical Pulse | Lost connection to Home Assistant |
| **Relay ON** | Solid Orange | Output relay is ON |
| **Relay OFF** | Solid Green | Output relay is OFF |
| **Factory Reset Requested** | Solid Blue, Fast Pulse | Hold button >10s, factory reset pending |
| **Overcurrent Detected** | Solid Red, Fast Pulse | Current exceeded configured limit, power cut |

**Notes:**

- The LED updates automatically based on device state.
- Factory reset is triggered by holding the button for more than 10 seconds.
