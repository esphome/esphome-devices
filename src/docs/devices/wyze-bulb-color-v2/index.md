## Gernal Notes

Wyze updated their original wyze bulb color which makes it slightly easier to flash esphome. The V2 features an esp32-c3 that controls a BP5758 LED driver. [Product Page](https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-bulb-color)

## Materials

- usb-uart adapter for flashing
- wire (I use gpio jumper wires)
- soldering iron and solder
- flat blade or metal spudger

## Instructions

1. Remove the plastic globe. This is held in with adhesive and can be removed with a flat blade or metal spudger
2. Remove the LED array. This is also only held in with adhesive so just pry it up by one of the sides. Be careful not to damage the 6 metal pins and the antenna that go through the led array plate.
3. Remove the potting. The potting only needs to be removed on the side opposite of the 6 led pins. Be careful not to damage any components on the board while removing.

4. Solder to pads on the bulb. The tight space can make this tricky but it's very doable. Make sure you aren't shorting anything.

5. Connect your wires to your usb-uart adapter and flash. See connection chart below.
6. Reassemble the bulb in reverse
