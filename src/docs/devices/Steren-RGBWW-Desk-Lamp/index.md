Smart desk lamp with a sleek design, it has RGB and warm/cold white LEDs.
it uses pwm to control each channel.
You can flash it, you can use tuya cloud-cutter, or you can swap out the chip.

I attempted to flash the chip multiple times, but my FTDI adapter couldn’t provide enough current for a successful process. In the end, I followed Digiblur’s Tuya Cloudcutter guide, which is referenced in the ESPHome documentation for BK72xx, and that did the trick.
