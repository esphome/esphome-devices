The Inkbird ITC-308-WIFI is a wireless temperature controller that comes in a variety of socket types for independant refridgeration and heating of wired devices.

## WiFi Modules

Older models ship with a Tuya TYWE3S module, which is an Espressif ESP8266-based module. Later models have replaced the module with the Tuya WBR3S module, utilizing the Realtek RTL8720DN chip. It's important to note that as of late 2023, LibreTiny, and therefore ESPHome, do not offer support for this particular chipset.  I have attempted to solder in an ESP12-S which is pin compatible, but whilst I was able to read the current temperature no other functions worked.

## Flashing

The TYWE3S sits on a daughter board which needs to be desoldered before flashing.  The RST and EN pins to be held at 3.3V in order to programmable.

## Board Configuration

```yaml
esphome:
  # Required to get the relay status at boot
  on_boot:
    priority: 600
    then:
        - lambda: |-
            if ((id(relay_status_internal).state == 1)) {
              id(relay_status).publish_state("Cooling");
            }
            else if ((id(relay_status_internal).state == 2)) {
              id(relay_status).publish_state("Off");
            }
            else if ((id(relay_status_internal).state == 3)) {
              id(relay_status).publish_state("Heating");
            }
