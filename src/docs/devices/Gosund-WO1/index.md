## Flashing

As of 2022-03-25, this device can be flashed with Tuya Convert OTA (over-the-air) out of the box with no adjustments needed.  Put the device in flash mode by long-holding either button until it starts fast-flashing.  Alternately, there are exposed pins on the ESP board for serial connection, but that method has not been tried or verified, as it wasn't necessary.

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin    | Function                               |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| GPIO0  | Top outlet LED (Inverted: true)        |
| GPIO2  | Status LED (Inverted: true)            |
| GPIO4  | HLW8012 CF1 pin                        |
| GPIO5  | BL0937 CF pin                          |
| GPIO12 | HLW8012 SEL pin (Inverted: true)       |
| GPIO13 | Bottom outlet LED (Inverted: true)     |
| GPIO14 | Bottom outlet relay                    |
| GPIO15 | Top outlet relay                       |

## General Notes

These devices appear to be individually calibrated for voltage.  As a result, you will need to measure with a multimeter and adjust the voltage divider accordingly.  The observed range so far for voltage divider is 1646-1692, so the base configuration has been adjusted to be the average of range at 1670 for likely best default settings.  You can adjust the voltage divider in the substitutions section if needed.

# Device Specific Config

# Some things may need to be adjusted for hardware or preference differences.
# Adjust them here:
substitutions:
  # Note: Voltage divider on the BL0937 may vary from device to device.
  # If your voltage appears off, adjust that number as necessary.
  # The default voltage divider is about 25% too high.
  # In testing 4 separate devices, the range was 1646-1692, with a range
  # average of 1670.
  voltage_div: "1670"
  # Update interval (Time) for power sensors.  Because of a hardware limitation
  # (BL0937 swaps between current and voltage, and throws out the first value
  # after the swap), voltage and current will update at quadruple the interval.
  # In order to have everything update at least every 60 seconds, an update
  # interval of 15s is needed.
  # Power and energy will update each update_interval.
