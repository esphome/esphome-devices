## General Notes

This 120V wall outlet comes with a customized Tasmota pre-installed, and has two independently switchable 120V outlets and a switchable USB outlet.

It is optimized for Home Assistant, Domoticz and OpenHab but you can easily flash an ESPHome binary using the Firmware Upgrade function in the built-in web interface.
