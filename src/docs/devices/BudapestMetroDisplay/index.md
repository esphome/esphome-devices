LED Display for the Budapest Metro and Suburban railway network.

The hardware of this project is a 210 mm x 300 mm sized bare PCB,
designed to fit into a picture frame, especially the IKEA LOMVIKEN.

The display shows a map of the subway and suburban railway network of
Budapest. At every stop there is an RGB LED, which can show whether a vehicle
is currently at that stop.
