## General Notes

The DETA [Smart Plug Base](https://www.bunnings.com.au/deta-smart-plug-base-with-grid-connect_p0098817) are made by Arlec as part of the [Grid Connect ecosystem](https://grid-connect.com.au/), and are sold at Bunnings in Australia and New Zealand. They can be flashed without disassembly or soldering [using tuya-convert](#tuya-convert).

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin | Function |
| --- | -------- |
| GPIO1 | Button |
| GPIO13 | Blue LED |
| GPIO14 | Relay |

## Getting it up and running

### Tuya Convert

These switches are Tuya devices, so if you don't want to open them up to flash directly, you can [use tuya-convert to initially get ESPHome onto them](/guides/tuya-convert/). After that, you can use ESPHome's OTA functionality to make any further changes.

- Put the switch into "smartconfig" / "autoconfig" / pairing mode by holding any button for about 5 seconds.
- The status LED blinks rapidly to confirm that it has entered pairing mode.
