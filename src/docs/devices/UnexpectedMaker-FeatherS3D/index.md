## Extended config to optimize CPU, Memory and Flash usage â€“ ESP-IDF Framework only

This config is for ESP-IDF framework, as we use specific SDK Config options.

- It sets a CPU frequency to 240 MHz
- It allocates memory on `malloc` calls from both internal and PSRAM memory
- It allows [Mbed TLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls) to allocate memory in PSRAM
- It increases the `nvs` partition at the cost of reducing the `app0`/`app1` partitions. It gives more space to store persisted variables.

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: "feathers3d"

esphome:
  name: ${device_name}

esp32:
  variant: esp32s3
  # FeatherS3[D] has a 16MB flash on a 240 MHz CPU
  cpu_frequency: 240MHz
  flash_size: 16MB
  # By default, esphome 2025.8.4 generates a partition file that maximizes app0 and app1 partitions
  # and keep nvs partition (used to save global variables) to 446 kB.
  # The partition file, included below, allocate more space to nvs
  # nvs is the partition used by the "preferences" components used to save persisted variables across reboots

      # By default, mbedtls only use internal memory.
      # CONFIG_MBEDTLS_DEFAULT_MEM_ALLOC=y tell mbedtls to use malloc.
      # It will therefore be able to allocate memory in PSRAM is CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE_MALLOC is enabled

### Partition file

Into a file named `partitions-16MB-nvs-extended.csv` next to your ESPHome YAML config, write this content:

```csv
otadata,  data,   ota, ,   0x2000,
phy_init, data,   phy, ,   0x1000,
app0,      app, ota_0, , 0x2F0000,
app1,      app, ota_1, , 0x2F0000,
nvs,      data,   nvs, , 0x400000,
```

This table allocates 2.94 MB for the application and 4 MB for the nvs partition (used to store global variables).
It fits for a 16 MB flash. It is possible to reduce the size of the `app0` and `app1` and increase the `nvs` partition.

| Partition | Size (hex) | Size (bytes)   | Size (MB) |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------- | --------- |
| otadata   | 0x2000     | 8,192          | 0.008     |
| phy_init  | 0x1000     | 4,096          | 0.004     |
| app0      | 0x2F0000   | 3,080,192      | 2.94      |
| app1      | 0x2F0000   | 3,080,192      | 2.94      |
| nvs       | 0x400000   | 4,194,304      | 4.0       |
| **Total** |            | **16,366,976** | **15.6**  |
