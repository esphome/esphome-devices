The Brilliant Smart WiFi wall mounted light switch is available in Australia. They come in single gang, twin, triple and quad gang configurations. They're a smooth glass front with round touch switches to control the lights.

## Getting Started

These devices are obstensibly Tuya controlled switches, but after re-flashing them with Tuya-Convert, they work nicely with ESPHome.
I flashed mine directly from the existing Tuya to ESPHome. (Some people go to Tasmota first - there's no need.)
