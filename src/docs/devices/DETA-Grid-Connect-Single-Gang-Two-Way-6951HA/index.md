## Overview

The DETA [Smart Switch Single Gang Two-Way (6951HA)](https://www.bunnings.com.au/deta-grid-connect-smart-single-gang-2-way-touch-light-switch_p0346910) is part of the [Grid Connect ecosystem](https://grid-connect.com.au/), and is sold at Bunnings in Australia.

Also known as:

- Smart Single Gang 2 Way Touch Light Switch

### Variations

As shown on the front of the packet.

| Variation   | Microcontroller | Board     | Firmware | Flashing methods |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Series 1    | Beken BK7231T   | Tuya WB3S | v1.1.5   | Cloudcutter  |

## Setup Guide

### Cloudcutter

[Cloudcutter](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter) is a tool designed to simplify the flashing process. Follow the [official guide](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter) for instructions.

You can use the “Lonsonho” brand “X801A 1-Gang Switch” option in Cloudcutter.

### Manual Flashing

Manual Flashing has not been tested on this specific model, but other models with the same chip have been tested and these manual steps work, you'll need a USB to serial adapter. Follow the disassembly steps below:

1. Remove the front plastic face.
2. Unscrew the two exposed screws.
3. Remove the clear panel and the small PCB underneath.

> **Tip**: You can convert these switches to ESPHome by replacing the WB3S chip with an ESP-12E or ESP-12F chip and adding a 10k pull-down resistor on GPIO15.

## GPIO Pinouts

### Series 1 (WB3S) GPIO Pinouts

_See [Pinouts on WB3S Module Datasheet](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/wb3s-module-datasheet?id=K9dx20n6hz5n4#title-5-Interface%20pin%20definition) for more detail_

| Pin    | Function                                                                          |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P24    | Status LED  _(inverted)_ |
| P26    | Button  _(inverted)_ |
| P14    | Relay and Button LED  |
| P8     | Light activation status, taking into account the _local_ activation (this device) xor the _remote_ activation (another device) _(inverted)_     |

> **Note**: Each relay shares a pin with its associated LED.

## Advanced Modifications

To gain individual control of button LEDs, remove specific diodes and solder a wire from the cathode side of the diode pad to a spare GPIO pin. [See this example](https://community-assets.home-assistant.io/optimized/4X/f/9/b/f9b1f8ea23ccc1049ea4eda1765e3f19fb173925_2_666x500.jpeg).
