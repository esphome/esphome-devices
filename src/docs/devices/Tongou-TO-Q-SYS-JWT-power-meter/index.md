## Device Overview

The [device](https://www.tongou.com/product/single-phase-din-rail-smart-meter) is a DIN-rail power meter with a relay inside. Some aspects to consider:

- This is not an IEC/EN 60898 compliant circuit breaker. The relay inside is able to break the circuit and is rated for 60A (markings on the relay, 50A rating on the device box), however, it's not meant to be used a circuit breaker - use smart MCBs instead if you need one (Tongou has smart MCBs as well);
- It only breaks the line connected to the L terminal - the N terminal is simply attached to a piece of metal spanning the body of the device;
- The relay inside is [bistable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay#Latching_relay) as it maintains its position without power applied. If you set the power-on mode via the MCU, the old state will be maintained until the MCU is powered on and only then will it set the state based on the policy that was set (always on, always off, restore previous);
- The MCU inside is [HC32F460](https://m.huazhoucn.com/upFiles/common/2023/04/HC32F460%20series%20Datasheet%20Rev1.3.pdf) and is accessible via UART1 of the CBU board (the same UART that is used for flashing). It runs the firmware that complies with the standard [Tuya MCU protocol](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/mcu-standard-protocol/MCUSDK-wifi-base?id=Kd2bxu84567gk);
- The MCU firmware actually interfaces with the metering sensors and so calibration is not required.
- Some MCU settings are only possible to configure remotely (like the prepaid switch ones), some are only possible to set via the physical buttons (like the period of time for which the measured parameters must stay above/below the limits so that the configured action gets triggered) and some are possible to set remotely and via on-device buttons (like the limits themselves).

## UART Buffer Size Adjustment

The MCU sends Tuya data points quickly and needs 300+ bytes of UART buffer space. The CBU chip running Esphome is not able to process incoming bytes fast enough so many data points get discarded with the default buffer size of 64 bytes.

As it is [not possible to override](https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/6240#issuecomment-2349516017) this setting easily, this config just incorporates a downstream change to alter the buffer size.

Therefore, the attached config relies on a [version of ArduinoCore-API](https://github.com/dshcherb/ArduinoCore-API/releases/tag/2025.1.4) based on upstream 1.5.1 with two patches:

- The buffer size increase from default 64 bytes to 1024 bytes: https://github.com/dshcherb/ArduinoCore-API/commit/365122ef16e4065a4cc06c4f1db786a5f6d0b7d8
- The printf feature patch from the [Libretiny fork](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ArduinoCore-API/commit/3a4cbfcc88f8c2c6b52e406745cd51db1370f621) of ArduinoCoreAPI: https://github.com/dshcherb/ArduinoCore-API/commit/ce57327c3bbcb70d007f915a1c5c92dd6f16a5f1

## Flashing Instructions

The PSU inside that provides power to the control board has isolation from the mains unlike in some other products: a multimeter will show MOhms if you attach the neutral wire of the control board and the N terminal. However, avoid trying to reflash the device when it's powered from mains - this is too dangerous for your hardware and well-being.

The main board with the CBU chip is easily detachable from the main board but pins are very small (not the usual 2.54mm or 1.27mm dupont pins). When detached you can use something like PCBite hands-free probes, crafted [PIZZAbite](https://github.com/whid-injector/PIZZAbite) probes or simply various kinds of hooks (e.g. [1](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005001998124173.html) or [2](https://aliexpress.com/item/32661192484.html)).

[CBU](https://docs.libretiny.eu/boards/cbu/#pinout) needs 4 pins to be flashed:

- RX1 (connect to TX of your UART)
- TX1 (connect to RX of your UART)
- 3.3V
- GND

## Disassembly and Reassembly

The rivets holding the device together seem to be DIN 7340 type B (d1 = 2mm, L ~= 16mm) hollow rivets. As the rivets are small in diameter it is not possible to remove them without drilling.

A 2mm hole can be drilled but there is enough plastic to make a `D = 2.5mm` hole with a `P = 0.5mm` [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_thread) in it for an [M3-0.5 x 18mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_metric_screw_thread#Preferred_sizes) screw (`18mm` being the length of the screw and the width of the device). Get a metric [tap and die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_and_die) set that has M3x0.5 in it and carefully prepare the holes (it's better to detach the plastic case parts when doing that).

## Data Points

Provided that the UART buffer size is increased, you should see the data points during the Tuya module initialization.
