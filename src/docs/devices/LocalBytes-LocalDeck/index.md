Preflashed with ESPHome

The LocalDeck keypad lets you control your smart home in one convenient place.  
With 24 buttons – customisable and RGB backlit – this keypad makes controlling your home easy and instant for the whole family. (Yes, even your significant other).  
And we’re just going to say it – it looks pretty cool.  
Designed with super durable Kailh MX Brown Switches, you can be sure your deck will suit the style of any room.
