## TOPGREENER TGWF115APM Smart Outlet with Energy Monitoring

This is for flashing a TOPGREENER TGWF115APM to ESPHome. This requires disassembling the device and soldering to pads on the board. Full instructions can be found on Reddit here: [www.reddit.com/r/Esphome/comments/1k6hyh3/topgreener_tgwf115apm_wifi_plug_esphome_install/](www.reddit.com/r/Esphome/comments/1k6hyh3/topgreener_tgwf115apm_wifi_plug_esphome_install/)

> The YAML below was orignally made by [@cbpowell](https://github.com/cbpowell) from here: https://github.com/cbpowell/ESPSense/wiki/TOPGREENER-TGWF115APM
> I simply fixed the syntaxing and removed the ESPSense additions.

## ESPHome YAML

```yaml
# Configuration for TGWF115APM (Big 15A plug)
# Updated by Jwidess 4-23-2025

substitutions:
  plug_name: topgreener-apm
  # Plug state to set upon powerup (or after power loss)
  # See options here: https://esphome.io/components/switch/gpio.html
  restore_mode: ALWAYS_ON
  
  # Base calibration to 90W lightbulb, Kill-a-Watt between plug and wall
  # Detail calibration can be done with calibrate_linear sensor filters below
  current_res: "0.00228"
  voltage_div: "2120"
  # Increasing current_res reduces reported wattage
  # Increasing voltage_div increases reported voltage
