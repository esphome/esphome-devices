## General Notes

The DETA [Smart Dimmer Switch 6910HA](https://www.bunnings.com.au/deta-white-grid-connect-smart-touch-single-dimmer_p0237206) uses the UART on GPIO 1 and 3. This switch comes with a WB3S chip and requires replacement in order to be used with ESPHome.
It is still possible to convert these switches to ESPHome by replacing the WB3S chip with a ESP-12F chip and adding a 10k pull-down resister on GPIO15 as WB3S does not require it and omits it from the board.

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin    | Function      |
| ------ | ------------- |
| GPIO1  | UART TX       |
| GPIO3  | UART RX       |
| EN     | 10k pull-up   |
| RES    | 10k pull-up   |
| GPIO15 | 10k pull-down |

## Getting it up and running

These switches are Tuya devices, however as the main W3BS chip needs to be replaced with a ESP12F it is best to serial flash the unit. There's useful guide to disassemble and serial flash these switches [here.](https://blog.mikejmcguire.com/2020/05/22/deta-grid-connect-3-and-4-gang-light-switches-and-home-assistant/) After that, you can use ESPHome's OTA functionality to make any further changes.
