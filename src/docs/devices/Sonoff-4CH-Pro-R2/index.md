## LED Configuration

Use _one_ of the following three configurations to adjust the led to your needs.  Note:  Using the Status LED on the 4CH Pro may cause relay 4 to activate on power up.

### Status LED (see <https://esphome.io/components/status_led.html>)

```yaml
status_led:
  pin:
    number: GPIO13
    inverted: True
```

### Always-on led (plugged in == led on)

```yaml
output:
  - platform: esp8266_pwm
    id: blue_led
    pin: GPIO13
    inverted: True

light:
  - platform: monochromatic
    name: "Blue LED"
    output: blue_led
    restore_mode: ALWAYS_ON
    internal: true
```

### Normal light, toggleable via Home Assistant

```yaml
output:
  - platform: esp8266_pwm
    id: blue_led
    pin: GPIO13
    inverted: True

light:
  - platform: monochromatic
    name: "Blue LED"
    output: blue_led
```
