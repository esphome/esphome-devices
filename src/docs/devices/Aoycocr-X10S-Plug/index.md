title: Aoycocr-X10S Power Monitoring Plug
date-published: 2020-05-09
type: plug
standard: us
board: esp8266
---

This device did not have a serial number. FCC-ID is [2AKBP](https://fccid.io/2AKBP-X10S).
This device shares the FCC-ID with [Kauf plugs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JQ8MMNH/) and also [Cloudfree smartplug 2](https://cloudfree.shop/product/cloudfree-smart-plug-runs-tasmota/)

This template was based on the AWP04L template and modified for this device. I used a Kill-A-Watt meter to measure voltage, current and watts of the plug with and without a downstream device turned on. The downstream device was an LED bulb. Power Factor was .93 on the Kill-A-Watt meter

The GPIO pinout was learned from [Blakadder Tasmota](https://templates.blakadder.com/aoycocr_X10S.html) documentation.

## GPIO Pinout

Note: You will want to exclude the red_led and blue_led lights from your recorder component, especially if you use the included Throb custom animation, since that would fill your database with the on/off blinking status updates.
