## Product Description

The Nous A8M is a 16A EU smart socket with energy monitoring, a physical button, and an LED status indicator.
It is based on the BK7231N chip and ships with Matter support.

**Specifications:**

- Operating Voltage: 220–240 V AC
- Maximum Load: 16 A (3840 W)
- Standby Power: 1.3 W
- Connectivity: 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n)
- Dimensions: 45 × 45 × 73 mm
- Protection: IP20

## Flashing

### Important: Bootloader Mismatch (Matter variant)

Nous A8M plugs with Matter support ship with a **Tuya bootloader v3.0.0** instead of v1.0.1.
This causes two issues during conversion:

- OTA updates appear to succeed but are never applied — the v3.0 bootloader layout is incompatible
  with what the v1.0.1-based flow expects, so the partition swap does not occur.
- Devices flashed without accounting for the different layout show an incorrect MAC address
  (e.g. `C8:47:8C:00:00:00`) because calibration/userdata TLVs are read from the wrong offsets.

**Solution:** Flash the bkboot 1.0.1 bootloader before flashing ESPHome firmware:

```bash
ltchiptool write <port> bk7231n 0x0 bk7231n-1.0.1-encrypted-tuya.bin --length 0x11000
```

The `board_flash.calibration` platformio option in the configuration below is also required to read
calibration data from the correct offset.

### Flashing Steps

Use `ltchiptool` to flash the device over UART. You will need to open the device and connect to the
UART pads on the BK7231N chip (TX, RX, GND, and briefly bridge CEN to GND to enter flash mode).

1. Flash the bkboot 1.0.1 bootloader as shown above.
2. Flash the ESPHome firmware using `ltchiptool` or the ESPHome OTA mechanism.
