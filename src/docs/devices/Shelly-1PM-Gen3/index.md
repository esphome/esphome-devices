title: Shelly 1PM Gen3
date-published: 2025-03-01
type: relay
standard: uk, us, eu, au, nz
board: esp32
difficulty: 2
---

This is the third generation of the Shelly 1PM.  It sports a single 16A
relay, power monitoring, and uses the ESP-Shelly-C38F, a derivative of
the ESP32-C3 with 8MB flash.

This device includes the Belling BL0942 Energy Monitor that is supported
by ESPHome.

## Serial Pinout

The Shelly 1PM Gen3 includes the six-pin "proprietary serial interface"
1.27mm header broken out on the back that can be used for flashing.  An
inexpensive 1.27mm to 2.54mm pitch changer board can make flashing these
devices easier than they already are.

The serial pinout is:

| Pin | Label        | Description | GPIO   |
|-----|--------------|-------------|--------|
| 1   | ESP_DBG_UART |             | GPIO19 |
| 2   | U0TXD        | UART0 RX    | GPIO20 |
| 3   | U0RXD        | UART0 TX    | GPIO21 |
| 4   | +3.3_ESP     | 3.3v        |        |
| 5   | _n/c_          | _unused_      |        |
| 6   | GPIO0        | BootSEL     | GPIO0  |
| 7   | GND          | Ground      |        |

## Additional Considerations

### BL0942 Energy Monitor

The default update interval for the BL0942 energy monitor is 60 seconds,
which may be too slow for some applications (especially safety shutdown,
if implemented; see below). Add `update_interval: 1s` to the bl0942 sensor
if desired.

The calibration of values reported by the BL0942 is left to software. The
component has default calibration values but they may not be accurate for
every device. Add in new calibration values based on measurements with a
quality digital multimeter and a simple resistive load.

_See [ESPHome Documentation](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/bl0942.html) for more details._

### Safety Shutdown Option

On manufacturer firmware, Shelly products provide automatic shutdown of
the relay output(s) on overcurrent and overtemperature conditions.

Following is a configuration snippet to restore this functionality
with manual reset required for both faults. _(Note: bl0942 update_interval
must be fast-acting for this function.)_

```yaml

    pin: GPIO4

          # Temperature sensor is unknown for several seconds on boot. Allow the relay to switch on anyway.
          - and:
