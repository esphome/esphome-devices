## Installation

*NOTE*: Try not to lose the original calibration data. If you have set up the device with Tuya, first see [Calibration](#calibration) and extract the calibration data from the running unit. And make sure you read the full 2MiB of the original flash before overwriting it.

These units generally ship with a firmware which is no longer exploitable by tuya-fwcutter,
so some disassembly will be required to flash using serial.

First, the 6 rivets need to be drilled out with a 2mm drill bit. You'll need something to replace
these when you reassemble the unit; M1.6 nuts and 16mm bolts work well.

Once open, lift out the control board so that you can see the BL0942 chip on the reverse side,
behind the CBU module:

All the pins you need to flash the device are accessible from the BL0942 with SOIC probes:

- VDD / +3.3v (pin 1)
- GND (pin 5)
- RX (pin 9)
- TX (pin 10)

Note that the TX pin of the BL0942 corresponds to the RX pin of the BL72xx module, and vice versa.

You don't need to completely remove the board from the device, as shown in the picture below. But do not attempt to flash it while it's connected to the mains!

When ltchiptool says `Getting bus... (now, please do reboot by CEN or by power off/on)` first make sure you have read the [Calibration](#calibration) section and you are *reading* the flash before overwriting it. Then disconnect and reconnect the GND line, and it should proceed.

## Calibration

The factory calibration settings for the BL0942 are available in two ways. First, as DPS values 22-25 in the Tuya API, as reported by tools such as [tinytuya](https://pypi.org/project/tinytuya/), for example:

```python
#!/bin/python3

import tinytuya
d = tinytuya.OutletDevice(
      dev_id='DEVICE_ID_HERE',
      address='IP_ADDRESS_HERE',
      local_key='LOCAL_KEY_HERE',
      version=3.4)

data = d.status()
print("UREF: %d" % data['dps']['22'])
print("IREF: %d * 10" % data['dps']['23'])
print("PREF: %d / 10" % data['dps']['24'])
print("EREF: %d" % data['dps']['25'])
```

Sample results:

```us
UREF: 15968
IREF: 12418 * 10
PREF: 3091 / 10
EREF: 2653
```

Alternatively, the values may be stored in flash in the "key value store" Tuya partition, typically at address `0x001d5000`:

```us
001d5000  60 3e 00 00 82 30 00 00  13 0c 00 00 5d 0a 00 00  |`>...0......]...|
```

- UREF = 0x3e60 = 15968
- IREF = 0x3082 = 12418 (times ten to make 124180)
- PREF = 0xc13 = 3091 (divide by ten to make 309.1)
- EREF = 0xa5d = 2653

You can use these checks to validate the values you see:

- PREF = UREF × IREF × 3537 / (305978 × 73989)
- EREF = PREF × 3600000 / 419430.4

Applying those sanity checks to the example above, we get:

- PREF = 12968 × 124180 × 3537 / (305978 × 73989) = 309.8 *(close enough)*
- EREF = 309.1 × 3600000 / 419430.4 = 2653.0 *(spot on)*

The PREF values in the Tuya firmware are often a little lower than the calculation would suggest, but close enough that you can be confident you're looking at the right values.

If the calibration data are not available, it's still possible to calibrate the voltage and current against an external meter, and the power and energy calibrations can be calculated from that.
