title: AWP04L Power Monitoring Plug
date-published: 2019-10-15
type: plug
standard: us
board: esp8266
---

These devices come with different brands, but all have AWP04L serial number on the back sticker. FCC-ID is [2ANOO-SM800](https://fccid.io/2ANOO-SM800).

This template has been updated with "comment:" and "captive_portal:" feautures added in ESPHome v. 1.14

## GPIO Pinout

Note: You will want to exclude the red_led and blue_led lights from your recorder componant, especially if you use the included Throb custom animation, since that would fill your database with the on/off blinking status updates.

## Split Configuration

If you have several of these plugs, you may prefer to keep the shared code in one file and only put the device-specific code in the files for each plug.
