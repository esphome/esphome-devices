## General Notes

The **Dikale Filament Dryer PCB** by **SiloCityLabs** is a custom PCB designed to replace the original PCB of the Dikale Filament Dryer. The PCB is based on an **ESP32** and can be controlled via **Home Assistant** using the **ESPHome** firmware. The PCB features a **temperature sensor** and a **humidity sensor** to monitor the conditions inside the dryer. The PCB also features a **display** to show the current temperature and humidity, as well as a **button controll** to adjust the settings.

The PCB is designed to fit inside the Dikale Filament Dryer and can be powered by the original power supply. The PCB can be connected to the original heater and fan, and can be controlled via the original buttons.
