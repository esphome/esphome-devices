## üî• Opentherm Gateway ‚Äì DIN-Rail Smart Heating Interface for Home Assistant

![alt text](./opentherm.png "HOMAMASTER MicroPLC")

## Product description

## üå°Ô∏è Description

The Opentherm Gateway enables full bidirectional OpenTherm communication for intelligent climate control. It supports monitoring and control of key heating parameters such as burner status, flame modulation, setpoint temperatures, and system diagnostics.

A built-in high-voltage relay allows local control of zone valves or backup heaters, while two independent **1-Wire interfaces** support digital temperature sensors (e.g., DS18B20) for detailed room or system temperature monitoring.

## Programming

The OpenTherm Gateway comes with ESPHome pre-installed and can be configured via:

### Improv

Wi-Fi Configuration with Improv

1. Power on your HomeMaster OpenTherm Gateway.
2. Go to üëâ improv-wifi.com (works in Chrome/Edge on desktop or mobile).
3. Connect via USB (Serial) or Bluetooth LE.
4. Enter your Wi-Fi SSID and password, then press Connect.
5. The device joins your Wi-Fi and is now ready.

You can then access it via its local address (e.g., http://opentherm.local) or directly in Home Assistant.

### One-Click Import (ESPHome Dashboard Import)

Once connected to Wi-Fi, the OpenTherm Gateway will be automatically discovered in ESPHome Dashboard.
When the device appears in ESPHome Dashboard, click ‚ÄúTake Control‚Äù.
The OpenTherm Gateway supports dashboard import, automatically pulling its official configuration from GitHub

### USB Type-C: Use the ESPHome Dashboard to upload the configuration

1. Connect the OpenTherm Gateway to your computer with a USB Type-C cable.
2. Download the YAML configuration file from our GitHub repository.
3. Open the ESPHome Dashboard, import the YAML file, and update it with your Wi-Fi SSID and password.
4. Flash the device directly from ESPHome Dashboard.
5. The OpenTherm Gateway supports automatic reset and boot control ‚Äî there is no need to press reset or boot buttons during programming.
6. After flashing, the device will reboot automatically and run the updated firmware.

## üè† Integration with Home Assistant

When flashed with ESPHome, the Opentherm Gateway exposes the following entities in Home Assistant:

- Boiler on/off
- Burner status
- Flame modulation level (%)
- CH/DHW setpoint temperatures
- Boiler water temperature
- System pressure (if supported)
- Relay output status
- Temperature readings from connected 1-Wire sensors
- etc.
