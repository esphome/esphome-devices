## üî• Opentherm Gateway ‚Äì DIN-Rail Smart Heating Interface for Home Assistant

![alt text](./opentherm.png "HOMAMASTER Opentherm Gateway")

## üå°Ô∏è Description

The Opentherm Gateway enables full bidirectional OpenTherm communication for intelligent climate control. It supports
monitoring and control of key heating parameters such as burner status, flame modulation, setpoint temperatures, and
system diagnostics.

A built-in high-voltage relay allows local control of zone valves or backup heaters, while two independent **1-Wire
interfaces** support digital temperature sensors (e.g., DS18B20) for detailed room or system temperature monitoring.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **OpenTherm Interface**: Full OpenTherm communication with compatible boilers for temperature control and diagnostics
- **ESP32-WROOM-32U**: Wi-Fi/Bluetooth-enabled microcontroller with ESPHome pre-installed
- **Relay Output**: One high-voltage relay for local switching (e.g., heaters, zone valves)
- **Dual 1-Wire Interfaces**: Two isolated 1-Wire buses for temperature sensors like DS18B20
- **Power Options**: Operates on 24‚ÄØVDC or 220‚ÄØVAC/220VDC for flexible installation
- **USB Type-C**: For firmware updates, serial configuration, and power
- **OTA Updates**: Supported via ESPHome for wireless firmware management
- **Improv**: Wi-Fi Configuration
- **DIN-Rail Mountable**: Standardized enclosure for electrical cabinets
- **Status LEDs**: Visual indicators for power, relay, OpenTherm, and Wi-Fi status

## Programming

The OpenTherm Gateway comes with ESPHome pre-installed and can be configured via:

### üöÄ Improv ‚Äì Wi-Fi Configuration (Zero Configuration Setup)

To connect your **Homemaster OpenTherm Gateway** to your Wi-Fi without flashing, use **Improv**:

Power on your device.
Open [improv-wifi.com](https://www.improv-wifi.com) in **Chrome** or **Edge** (desktop or mobile).
Connect to the device using **USB (Serial)** or **Bluetooth LE**.
Enter your Wi-Fi credentials and click **Connect**.

![Wi-Fi Setup](./improv.png)

Once provisioned, you‚Äôll see confirmation:

![Provisioned](./improv_connected.png)

‚úÖ The device is now on your network.

You can now manage it from the **ESPHome Dashboard** or directly in **Home Assistant**, where it will appear automatically.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> The device does **not** host a web server by default, so accessing it via `http://opentherm.local`
> will **not work** unless `web_server:` is added to the YAML.  
> Also, because `name_add_mac_suffix: true` is set, the actual hostname includes a unique suffix,
> like `http://homemaster-opentherm-3f9a7c.local`. Use ESPHome or Home Assistant for discovery.

---

### üß© One-Click Import (ESPHome Dashboard)

Once connected to Wi-Fi, the OpenTherm Gateway will appear in your **ESPHome Dashboard** as a discovered device:

![Improv Discovered](./take_control.png)

- Click **Take Control** to claim the device.
- ESPHome will automatically pull the official config from GitHub.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è No manual flashing is needed if the device is provisioned via Improv.

### üíª USB Type-C Flashing (Manual Configuration)

1. Connect the OpenTherm Gateway to your computer with a USB Type-C cable.
2. Download the YAML configuration file from our GitHub repository.
3. Open the ESPHome Dashboard, import the YAML file, and update it with your Wi-Fi SSID and password.
4. Flash the device directly from ESPHome Dashboard.
5. The OpenTherm Gateway supports automatic reset and boot control ‚Äî there is no need to press reset or boot buttons
   during programming.
6. After flashing, the device will reboot automatically and run the updated firmware.

```yaml
opentherm:
  id: ot_bus
  in_pin: 21
  out_pin: 26
```

## üè† Integration with Home Assistant

When flashed with ESPHome, the Opentherm Gateway exposes the following entities in Home Assistant:

- Boiler on/off
- Burner status
- Flame modulation level (%)
- CH/DHW setpoint temperatures
- Boiler water temperature
- System pressure (if supported)
- Relay output status
- Temperature readings from connected 1-Wire sensors
- etc.
  
Once uploaded, the above entities will automatically appear in Home Assistant if OpenTherm communication is working correctly.

## üß∑ Connection Diagrams ‚Äì Homemaster OpenTherm Gateway

Below are reference diagrams and safety notes for connecting **power**, **OpenTherm bus**,
**1-Wire sensors**, and **relay outputs** to your Homemaster OpenTherm Gateway.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety First

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**
>
> - Disconnect all power before installation or wiring changes.
> - Use proper insulation and terminals when working with **230‚ÄØVAC** mains voltage.
> - Use appropriately rated **fuses or circuit breakers** (e.g., 1A slow-blow) as shown in schematics.
> - The device contains opto-isolated and ESD-protected interfaces for safe signal connections.
> - Always refer to your **boiler's OpenTherm specification** before wiring the OT bus.

---

### üîå Power Supply Options

You can power the device using either:

#### üîã 1. 24‚ÄØVDC Low Voltage Power

Connect a **24‚ÄØVDC power supply** to the `+V` and `0V` terminals..

![24VDC Connection](./OpenTherm_24Vdc.png)

---

#### ‚ö° 2. 230‚ÄØVAC Mains Power

If using mains voltage, connect **L** (Live) and **N** (Neutral) to the terminal block.

![230VAC Connection](./OpenTherm_230Vac.png)
*Figure: AC mains power input connection*

---

### üîÅ Relay Output (Dry Contact)

The relay output is **optically isolated** (via PC817 and S8050 driver stage) and capable
of switching **AC or DC loads** up to 6A.  
Use it to control zone valves, pumps, or backup heating.

![Relay Connection](./OpenTherm_RelayConnection.png)

---

### üå°Ô∏è 1-Wire Sensor Connections

Two independent **1-Wire buses** are available, each with:

- ESD protection (DS9503)
- Series resistor + clamping diodes
- Separate power lines (`1-WIRE1`, `1-WIRE2`) and +5V rail

You can connect **DS18B20** sensors using parasitic or powered mode.

![1-Wire Connection](./OpenTherm_1WireConnection.png)

---

### üîÑ OpenTherm Bus Wiring

Connect the boiler‚Äôs **OpenTherm interface** to the OT+ and OT‚àí terminals.

**Note:** These lines are optically isolated and buffered using:

- BAV99S protection diodes
- OpenTherm transceivers and opto-isolators (e.g., PC817)
- Pull-ups and current-limiting resistors

![OpenTherm Bus](./OpenTherm_OTConnection.png)

### ‚úÖ Recommended Wire Sizes

| Function       | Recommended Wire Gauge |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Power (24‚ÄØVDC) | 0.5‚Äì1.0‚ÄØmm¬≤             |
| Power (230‚ÄØVAC) | 1.0‚Äì1.5‚ÄØmm¬≤             |
| Relay Output   | 1.0‚Äì1.5‚ÄØmm¬≤             |
| 1-Wire Sensors | 0.22‚Äì0.5‚ÄØmm¬≤ (shielded if long) |
| OpenTherm Bus  | 0.22‚Äì0.5‚ÄØmm¬≤ twisted pair |

> üìò **Tip**: Always follow **local electrical code** and **boiler manufacturer guidelines** when wiring heating systems.

**Notes**:

- Verify polarity and follow **electrical safety standards** at all times.
- Telemetry and control features depend on your **boiler‚Äôs OpenTherm support**. Check the boiler manual for details.
