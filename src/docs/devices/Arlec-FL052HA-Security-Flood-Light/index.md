The Arlec FL052HA security flood light is part of the [Grid Connect ecosystem](https://grid-connect.com.au/) and is sold at Bunnings in Australia.

As of the time of writing, versions `1019` or `0320` can be flashed using tuya-convert, however if it is version `0520` OTA flashing **will not work**.

You can check these versions by looking at the bottom left of the Arlec product plaque. See below examples;

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin    | Function                  |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| GPIO14 | LED Light (Monochromatic) |

## Getting it up and running

### Tuya Convert

As the flood lights do not have any physical buttons, you will follow the same flashing method that a Tuya Edison or Bayonet bulb will follow by turning the flood light on and off three times. This will cause the flood light to start flashing indicating you have entered pairing mode.

- Connect and disconnect power from flood light three times.
- Flood light will start flashing - this indicates the device has entered pairing mode successfully and is ready to see tuya-convert.
- Follow tuya-convert [flashing procedure](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert).
