## Product description

This is a 2-relay board with an ESP-12F.

Each relay has COM+NO+NC exposed. Product descriptions don't seem to specify maximum load.

The board can be powered either via 90-250VAC or via 7-30VDC, or via 5VDC (separate connectors).

I bought it from: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003516399175.html (no affiliation, no guarantee it will continue to exist).

## GPIO Pinout

This board has headers for every GPIO pin on its ESP-12F.
