## Product description

This is a 2-relay board with an ESP-12F.

Each relay has COM+NO+NC exposed. Relay load of up to 250VAC or 30VDC.

The board can be powered either via 7-80VDC, or via 5VDC (separate connectors).

I bought it from: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003516399175.html (no affiliation, no guarantee it will continue to exist).

## GPIO Pinout

This board has headers for every GPIO pin on its ESP-12F.
