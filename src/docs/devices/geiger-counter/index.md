With the help of `pulse_counter`and the RadiationD v1.1(CAJOE) you can make your own Geiger
counter, which will give you a more or less precise messurement of the
current radation level. But it should be good enough to warn you about
critical events.

## Assembly

![image](/radiationD-v1-1-cajoe_small.jpg)

The first step is to connect the sensor.

You just need to connect the +5V, the ground and a GPIO pin to the ESP.
In my case I used the pin 34 for the signal. (The print on the PCB is
wrong VIN is the signal.) This setup should give you the pulse of each
messurement or count. For more information check the Video of [Andreas
Spiess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K28Az3-gV7E).

### Housing

I just 3D printed an small housing the avoid touching the high voltage
Geiger Mueller tube. [Counter Tube
Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5425224) (The tube should not be
in direct sunlight. So maybe you will need another case.)

## Configuration

The block `pulse_counter` will count the radation events per minute. With the found
specs of the tube you will be able to calculate the radiation in μSv/h.

It\'s just the counts per minute (CPM) times the factor of your Geiger
Mueller tube you\'re using. It should be the J305ß, which comes with the
PCB. (To make sure - check your printing on the tube)

μSv/h = (CPM - Tube noise) \* Factor According to the video of [Andreas
Spiess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K28Az3-gV7E) the tube should
have about 12 CPM as background noise.

### Note

detectes Beta and Gamma radiation. Specifications: Manufacturer: North
