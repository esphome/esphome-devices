The Bauhn ASPU-1019 Smart Wall Plug is sold through ALDI in Australia.

They can be flashed without disassembly or soldering [using tuya-convert](#tuya-convert).

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin    | Function                  |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| GPIO04 | Relay                     |
| GPIO13 | Blue LED (Inverted: true) |
| GPIO14 | Button                    |

## Getting it up and running

### Tuya Convert

These wall plugs are Tuya devices, and you can compile the below code in ESPHome, "manually install" to get the .bin file, then [use tuya-convert to initially get ESPHome onto the device](/guides/tuya-convert/). After that, you can use ESPHome's OTA functionality to make any further changes.

- Put the switch into "smartconfig" / "autoconfig" / pairing mode by holding the button for about 5 seconds until it clicks
- The status LED blinks rapidly to confirm that it has entered pairing mode.

- Be patient with tuya-convert, and you may need to try a few times to get tuya-convert to connect to the device

## Basic Configuration

```yaml
# Change the below substitutions to something you prefer, and update the number for each new device you create
