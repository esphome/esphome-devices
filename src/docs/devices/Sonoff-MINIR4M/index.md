SONOFF'S First Matter Device, with one (detachable) relay, one external input, one button. Switch is really small, approx 40x33mm, easily fits behind wall switch.

Product page: [https://sonoff.tech/product/diy-smart-switches/minir4m/](https://sonoff.tech/product/diy-smart-switches/minir4m/)

## Features

Chip used: ESP32-C3

RISC-V 32-bit 160Mhz Microprocessor

4MB Flash

Flash locked

## Programming

Rx, Tx, Gnd and 3V3 pads are available, but due to Matter certification - ESP32-C3 flash is locked and no reflash is possible.

A new ESP32-C3 IC is required to programm the unit with ESPHome flash.

I bought an ESP32-C3 SuperMini module (with USB-C) and was able to flash it either with esptool or directly via ESPHome.

NOTE: Make sure to get the model with integrated 4MB flash.

After successfully flashing the new IC, simply replace the original IC with a custom one.
