CO2 measurement in a room matters because high CO2 levels indicate poor air quality, which can lead to fatigue, impaired cognitive function, and potential health risks. The LinkGear CO2 Ampel features a high-accuracy SCD41 CO2 sensor, a BME280 temperature/humidity/pressure sensor, an illuminance sensor, and 8 RGB LEDs that can meaningfully output sensor readings.

You can use our pre-configured ESPHome configuration to output the CO2 status on the LEDs or change it to your liking (e.g., to control the LEDs independently).
If you want to learn more, please check [our manual and instructions page](https://docs.linkgear.net/books/lg-eca1/)
