## Create device folder and markdown file

1. To add a new device create a new folder named after your device under the `src/docs/devices` directory in the
   [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-devices). In that folder, create a markdown (`.md`) file named
   `index.md` with the content. Please avoid using underscores or spaces in the filenames and use hypens instead as this
   makes for easier to understand the URLs generated when the site is built. When using the _Add file_ -> _Create new
   file_
   button in the `Devices` folder or by following
   [this link](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-devices/new/main/src/docs/devices),
   Github will automatically create a fork of the repository and a new branch for your changes. Just type the device
   name for
   the folder followed by a `/index.md` (including the slash).

   [Fork](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-devices/fork) on GitHub

2. Once you have written your file commit your changes and raise a pull request on GitHub. A guide for creating a pull
   request from a fork can be found
   [in the GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
   if you are unsure.

## YAML Front Matter

Each `.md` file created needs to contain front matter in order for the page to be generated. Details of the front matter
required (and optional) is detailed below:

## Images

To add images to your files do the following:

1. Add the images to your newly created device folder in `/src/docs/devices`
2. Add the images to your folder using the appropriate markdown syntax:

```md
![alt text](your-image.jpg "Image Hover Text")
```
