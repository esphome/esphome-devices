## Programming

The MicroPLC comes with ESPHome pre-installed and can be configured via:

### Improv

Wi-Fi Configuration with Improv

1. Power on your HomeMaster MicroPLC.
2. Go to üëâ improv-wifi.com (works in Chrome/Edge on desktop or mobile).
3. Connect via USB (Serial) or Bluetooth LE.
4. Enter your Wi-Fi SSID and password, then press Connect.
5. The device joins your Wi-Fi and is now ready.

You can then access it via its local address (e.g., <http://homemaster-microplc.local>) or directly in Home Assistant.

### One-Click Import (ESPHome Dashboard Import)

Once connected to Wi-Fi, the MicroPLC will be automatically discovered in ESPHome Dashboard.

When the device appears in ESPHome Dashboard, click ‚ÄúTake Control‚Äù.

The MicroPLC supports dashboard import, automatically pulling its official configuration from GitHub

### USB Type-C: Use the ESPHome Dashboard to upload the configuration

1. Connect the MicroPLC to your computer with a USB Type-C cable.
2. Download the YAML configuration file from our GitHub repository.(<https://github.com/isystemsautomation/HOMEMASTER/blob/main/MicroPLC/Firmware/microplc.yaml>)
3. Open the ESPHome Dashboard, import the YAML file, and update it with your Wi-Fi SSID and password.
4. Flash the device directly from ESPHome Dashboard.
5. The MicroPLC supports automatic reset and boot control ‚Äî there is no need to press reset or boot buttons during programming.
6. After flashing, the device will reboot automatically and run the updated firmware.
