## 🚀 Quick Start

You can copy the configuration code directly from the
[`m5stack-atoms3-lite-minimal.yaml`](m5stack-atoms3-lite-minimal.yaml) file and configure your secrets in ESPHome.

**Note**: This is a minimal hardware configuration. To add Home Assistant integration (API, OTA updates, web server),
you can extend the configuration with additional components. See the [ESPHome documentation](https://esphome.io/)
for details.

    # Button configuration
    pin:
      # The button is connected to GPIO41
      number: GPIO41

      # Inverted means pressed=LOW, released=HIGH (common for buttons with pullup)
      inverted: true

      # Pin mode configuration

    on_press:
      then:
        # Send Samsung TV power signal via IR LED
        - remote_transmitter.transmit_samsung:
            # Samsung TV power code (change this for other devices)
            data: 0xE0E040BF

        # Write a message to the logs for debugging
        - logger.log: "Samsung TV Power Signal sent"
```

## 🎯 Use Cases & Examples

### Example 1: IR Remote Control

Use as a universal remote control for TVs, ACs, and other IR devices.

```yaml
# The button is already configured to send Samsung TV power command
# Customize the IR code in the configuration:
on_press:
  then:
    - remote_transmitter.transmit_samsung:
        data: 0xE0E040BF  # Change this to your device code
```

Common Samsung TV codes:

- Power: `0xE0E040BF` or `0xE0E09966`
- Volume Up: `0xE0E0E01F`
- Volume Down: `0xE0E0D02F`
- Mute: `0xE0E0F00F`

### Example 2: Status Indicator

Use the RGB LEDs to show system status, notifications, or alerts. You can control the LEDs directly from the
configuration using automations, or extend the configuration with Home Assistant API integration for remote control.

## 🔌 GPIO Pinout

### Used Pins in Default Configuration

| GPIO | Function | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| GPIO35 | RGB LED | 4x WS2812 addressable LEDs |
| GPIO41 | Button | Built-in button (active low) |
| GPIO4 | IR TX | Infrared transmitter LED |

### Available Pins for Expansion

| GPIO | Use Case | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| GPIO1, GPIO2 | Grove Port | I2C, UART, or GPIO |
| GPIO5, GPIO6, GPIO7, GPIO8 | Expansion | General purpose I/O |
| GPIO38, GPIO39 | Expansion | General purpose I/O |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### IR Transmitter Range Issues

**IR commands not reaching target:**

- Ensure direct line-of-sight (1-3 meters max)
- Test with phone camera (IR LED visible as purple light)
- Consider external IR LED for longer range
- Adjust carrier duty cycle: `carrier_duty_percent: 30%`
