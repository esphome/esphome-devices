## Product description

This is a 4-relay board with an ESP-12F.

Each relay has COM+NO+NC exposed. Product descriptions don't seem to specify maximum load.

The board can be powered either via 90-250VAC or via 7-30VDC, or via 5VDC (separate connectors).

I bought it from: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001906928377.html (no affiliation, no guarantee it will continue to exist).

The board uses GPIO16 for RXD so it will always be briefly be powered on at boot, unforetunately this is also the pin the board is setup to use for relay1. If this brief power-on isn't an issue, you can continue to use GPIO16 or you can run a longer jumper over to a pin such as GPIO15.

## GPIO Pinout

This board has headers for every GPIO pin on its ESP-12F.
