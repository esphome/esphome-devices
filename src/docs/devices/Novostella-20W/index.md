5-channel PWM RGBWW smart flood light, 2700k-6500k tunable white with RGB colors, 20W, 2000LM, 120V AC, IP66 Waterproof, natively Tuya/Smart Life, works with Tuya-convert to flash to ESPHome. FCC-ID is [2AI5T-SFGD-002](https://fccid.io/2AI5T-SFGD-002/Internal-Photos/Internal-photos-4401574).

This template has been updated with "comment:" and "captive_portal:" feautures added in ESPHome v. 1.14

## Split Configuration

If you have several of these bulbs, you may prefer to keep the shared code in one file and only put the device-specific code in the files for each bulb.

In novoflood_common.yaml:
