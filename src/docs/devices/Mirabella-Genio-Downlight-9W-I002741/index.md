This contains a Tuya Beken Chip CB2L which can be flashed with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) and a USB to UART converter by soldering to the RX and TX pads on the back of the board, plus VCC and GND pins. It is not necassary to remove the CB2L chip from the unit to flash it.

It might be possible to flash (especially older units) [OTA using tuya-convert](/guides/tuya-convert/). If you attempt to flash a current unit OTA, you should update this page specify if it's still possible or not.

To open the downlight you need to take the difuser out. This can be done with a sharp knife or a small screwdriver buy may leave minor damage. A suction cup might work to pull it out unharmed.
