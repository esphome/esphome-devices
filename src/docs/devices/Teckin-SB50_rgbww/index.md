# TECKIN SB50 LED Bulb


![image](/teckin_sb50.jpg)


## Note

It is not currently possible to flash these bulbs with `tuya-convert`
due to shipping with an updated/patched firmware. Please check [this
issue](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/issues/483) for
details and progress on a workaround.

The Teckin SB50 Bulb\'s are a great option for lighting that could
previously be flashed with tuya-convert. More details can be found at
tuya-convert [github
page](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert). Below is the
ESPHome configuration file that will get you up and running. This
assumes you have a `secret.yaml` with ssid, password, api_password and
ota_password keys.
