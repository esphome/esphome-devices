title: RGB Smart Plug 16A with power monitoring
date-published: 2020-03-02
type: plug
standard: eu
board: esp8266
---

This plug can be found under many brand names (Lonsonho, Avatto, Vansware, … ) Identified by the packaging and the sticker inside the plug. At this time seems to be only EU plug with 16A, RGB color led and power metering.
