## General Notes

There's two hardware iterations of this particular IR blaster: with and without AHT20 Sensor, and [a simple one one that don't have temperture/humidity sensor](/devices/AVATTO-S06-IR-Remote-no-temp-no-humidity-new-version). Outwardly, both appear identical.

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin    | Function           |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| GPIO8  | Blue Status LED    |
| GPIO26 | Remote Transmitter |
| GPIO7  | Remote Receiver    |
| GPIO6  | Reset Button       |

## Getting it up and running

This device needs very likely to be flashed manually. Tuya-convert didn't worked for me. I have powered the device with
a mobile charger during the flashing procedure, as the used serial cable sets to logic level based on the input voltage.
Which is 3.3V in this case.
To enter a BOOT mode short-circuit the CEN and GND outputs

| Serial | CB3S        |
| ------ | ----------- |
| RX     | TX1         |
| TX     | RX1         |
| RTS    | CEN         |
| 3.3V   | 3.3V        |
| GND    | GND         |

### Flashing

```bash
# Create a backup of the original firmware
esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 230400 read_flash 0x00000 0x100000 avotta_s06Pro_original_firmware.bin

# Erase the flash
esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash

# Upload the esphome firmware
esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash -fs 1MB 0x0 ir_remote.bin
```
