## Product description

This is a 1-relay board based on ESP-12F, including AC and DC power supplies. It can be found in many online shops.

This might be the original source: http://www.chinalctech.com/m/view.php?aid=472

The relay has COM+NO+NC exposed. Print on relay says it can do 10A at 250VAC.

The board can be powered either via 90-250VAC or via 7-12VDC, or via 5VDC from USB.

All 5V inputs feed the same rail:

* the AC switchmode power supply
* the DC linear regulator
* the Micro-USB port

IMPORTANT: connect only one of the three power inputs at the same time!

The comon 5V rail feeds a 3.3V linear regulator.

## GPIO Pinout

This board has headers for every GPIO pin on its ESP-12F.

By default, the relay is connected to GPIO5. If you want to change that, remove R14 and connect the header "Relay" to the desired GPIO.

Programming header:

| Pin   | Comment                                                 |
