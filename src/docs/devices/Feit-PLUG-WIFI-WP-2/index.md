title: Feit Electric PLUG/WIFI/WP/2
date-published: 2025-10-26
type: plug
standard: us
board: bk72xx
difficulty: 4

This is a variant of the plug that has 2 outlets, instead of the 3 outlets in the PLUG3 variant.
It is marked FCC ID: `SYW-PLUGWFWP` and the IC is labeled: `SYCZB-MW-AK`.
This was heavily based on the great work alread done on other variants here:
[IC 2046-PLUG3WIFIN](/devices/Feit-PLUG3-WIFI-WP-2-N/)
and here [IC: 20416-PLUG3WIFI](/devices/Feit-PLUG3-WIFI-WP-2/).

Some versions of this 2 outlet versions shipped with ESP8266 boards, but this one had a
bk72xx, as discussed
[here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/costco-feit-dual-outlet-outdoor-smart-plug/167786).

Follow the steps in the great PLUG3 variant docs [here](/devices/Feit-PLUG3-WIFI-WP-2/) 
to flash your board via UART (the TX, RX, GND, and 3v3 pins are
all clearly silk screened on the board in this variant) using ltchiptool.
I lightly tack soldered to the pads,
but don't be like me and break a pad and have to dig up a trace to solder to :)

After building the device in ESPHOME and downloading the uf2 file,
the command to flash will be similar to this:
`ltchiptool flash write -d /dev/cu.usbserial-210 -b 115200 ./outdoor-switch1.uf2`

After flashing with ESPHome build, I found the pins in the
PLUG3 variant were not working and by trial and error found
the following ESPHome config / GPIO pins to work for this variant:

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin | Function          |
| --- | ----------------- |
| P15 | Relay             |
| P17 | Blue LED          |
| P23 | WiFi Power - why you might want this I don't know - maybe just to avoid it so you don't have to reflash thru UART!?! |
| P24 | Red LED           |
| P26 | Button            |
