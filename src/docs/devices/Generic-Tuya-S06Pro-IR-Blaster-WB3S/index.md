# Generic Tuya S06 Pro Wifi IR Blaster (WB3S)

![S06 Pro](tuya-s06-pro.jpg)

[S06 Pro](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4WmrJJt) universal remote controller with built-in temperature and humidity sensor (AHT10), based on the WB3S Wi-Fi module.

This device supports both IR transmitting and receiving, making it suitable for ESPHome IR remote projects such as air conditioners, TVs, fans, and other IR-controlled devices.

This device is based on PCB version `S06Pro-WB3S-AHT10-V2`. I also have a full detailed teardown and flashing instruction here: [Tuya S06 Pro Teardown](https://simplymaker.net/smart-home/tuya-s06-pro-ir-blaster-wb3s-teardown-and-esphome-flashing/)
