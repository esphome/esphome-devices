## Basic Config

The configuration has some default sensors for wifi reporting etc.
Some SHP7 devices experiences unexpected reboots after few minutes from start. By adding some config for GPIO15 it is solved.

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: shp7
  # Higher value gives lower watt readout
  current_res: '0.002291'
  # Lower value gives lower voltage readout
  voltage_div: '940'
  # BW-SHP7, dual outlet with powermonitoring.
  # One button for each relay, and one red led for each relay, as well as a blue status led
  # Static IP is configured, and fast_connect is enabled, as the SSID is hidden
  # Webserver is active and pw protected, and the OTA is password protected

```

## Advanced config additions

Starting with ESPHome v1.16.1 the `hlw8012` platform sensor now supports energy, so we can add the following to the `hlw8012` platform sensor and get rid of the `total_daily_energy` platform sensor and the `homeassistant` time sensor:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: hlw8012
    energy:
      name: "${device_name} Energy"
      unit_of_measurement: "Wh"
      icon: mdi:flash-outline
```

In the esphome section, you can perform actions when the device boots:

```yaml
  on_boot:
    then:
      - switch.turn_on: relay1
#  - switch.turn_on: relay2
```

Under wifi this can be added, this will set up static IP, allow the device to connect to a hidden SSID (fast_connect) and create a backup AP

```yaml
wifi:
  reboot_timeout: 60min
  manual_ip:
    static_ip: 192.168.1.100
    gateway: 192.168.1.1
    subnet: 255.255.255.0
  fast_connect: true

# Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails
  ap:
    ssid: "${device_name} Hotspot"
    password: !secret appw
```

This wll activate the internal webserver with password protection

```yaml
web_server:
  port: 80
  auth:
    username: !secret webuser
    password: !secret webpw
```

To set time locally to the same as on the HomeAssistant (better logging)

```yaml
# Sets time from Homeassistant
time:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: homeassistant_time
```

To have different data shown for the device (ESPHome version) and the wifi. Will appear as sensors in HA.

```yaml
# Sensors for ESP version and WIFI information
text_sensor:
  - platform: version
    name: "${device_name} ESPHome Version"
  - platform: wifi_info
    ip_address:
      name: "${device_name} ip"
    ssid:
      name: "${device_name} ssid"
```

This will create sensors so that you can track wifi coverage for the devices, and also note the uptime for the devices.

```yaml
sensors:
  - platform: wifi_signal
    name: '${device_name} WiFi Signal'
    update_interval: 60s
    accuracy_decimals: 0
  - platform: uptime
    name: '${device_name} Uptime'
    unit_of_measurement: days
    update_interval: 300s
    accuracy_decimals: 1
    filters:
      - multiply: 0.000011574
```
