## Product Description

This is a wall mounted light dimmer for EU standard wall boxes. The rotary dimmer is available in different versions (WiFi / ZigBee). The WiFi version with WB3S module is suitable for ESPHome and can be flashed directly.

## Flashing

The device contains a WB3S module (BK72xx, WiFi), which can be directly flashed using ltchiptool. 
Alternatively, it should also be possible to replace the module with e.g. a WT0132C6-S5 (ESP32C6) module.
