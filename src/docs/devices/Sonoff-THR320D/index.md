## Bootloop Workaround

Some people experience a boot loop when trying to flash esphome directly.
Here's a workaround: <https://community.home-assistant.io/t/bootloop-workaround-for-flashing-sonoff-th-elite-thr316d-thr320d-and-maybe-others-with-esphome-for-the-first-time/498868>

## GPIO Pinout

(Source: <https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_THR320D.html>)
Most GPIO are active-low, meaning they're "on" when they're pulled low.
In ESPHome that's often called "inverted".

| Pin    | Function                                                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------                                        |
| GPIO0  | Push Button (HIGH = off, LOW = on)                                        |
| GPIO4  | Small Relay (Dry Contact)                                                 |
| GPIO19 | Large/Main Relay pin 1                                                    |
| GPIO22 | Large/Main Relay pin 2, both have to be low to toggle the relay           |
| GPIO5  | Display (TM1621) Data                                                     |
| GPIO17 | Display (TM1621) CS                                                       |
| GPIO18 | Display (TM1621) Write                                                    |
| GPIO23 | Display (TM1621) Read                                                     |
| GPIO16 | Left LED (Red)                                                            |
| GPIO15 | Middle LED (Blue)                                                         |
| GPIO13 | Right LED (Green)                                                         |
