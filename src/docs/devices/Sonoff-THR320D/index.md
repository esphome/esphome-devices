## Bootloop Workaround

Some people experience a boot loop when trying to flash esphome directly.
Here's a workaround: <https://community.home-assistant.io/t/bootloop-workaround-for-flashing-sonoff-th-elite-thr316d-thr320d-and-maybe-others-with-esphome-for-the-first-time/498868>

## GPIO Pinout

(Source: <https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_THR320D.html>)
Most GPIO are active-low, meaning they're "on" when they're pulled low.
In ESPHome that's often called "inverted".

The main relay is bistable/latching, meaning a pulse on pin 1 switches the
relay ON, and a pulse on pin 2 switches the relay OFF.

| Pin    | Function                                                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------                                        |
| GPIO0  | Push Button (HIGH = off, LOW = on)                                        |
| GPIO4  | Small Relay (Dry Contact)                                                 |
| GPIO19 | Large/Main Relay pin 1, pull low for relay ON                             |
| GPIO22 | Large/Main Relay pin 2, pull low for relay OFF                            |
| GPIO5  | Display (TM1621) Data                                                     |
| GPIO17 | Display (TM1621) CS                                                       |
| GPIO18 | Display (TM1621) Write                                                    |
| GPIO23 | Display (TM1621) Read                                                     |
| GPIO16 | Left LED (Red)                                                            |
| GPIO15 | Middle LED (Blue)                                                         |
| GPIO13 | Right LED (Green)                                                         |

## Basic Configuration

Internal momentary switches are used to pulse the ON/OFF pins on the main relay. 
A template switch is used to hide the complexity of controlling the two internal 
momentary switches.

One shortcoming here is we don't have any way to confirm the true state of the
main relay, and so there is a possibility that our template switch could get out
of sync with the true state of the relay.
