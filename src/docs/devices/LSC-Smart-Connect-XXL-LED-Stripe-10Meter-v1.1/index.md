## General Notes

This configuration is for the second version of the [LSC Smart Connect XXL-LED-Strip 3202086](https://www.action.com/pl-pl/p/3202086/tasma-xxl-led-lsc-smart-connect/)
which comes as a colour changing LED strip with controller and transformer.

![LSC Smart Connect 10 meter XXL-LED-Stripe 3202086](Led-strip-photo.webp "LSC Smart Connect 10 meter XXL-LED-Strip 3202086")

## This is for the new version of the LED strip

The original version is here (insert original)

The main differences between the two versions are different board layout and different pins for the LEDs

To check what version you have open up the controller and look at the back of the board

## How to flash

To flash the controller, open up the controller and take the board out.
On the back of the board there are 4 pins you need to solder
| GND | 3.3V | 1TX | 1RX |

#### Warning: It is important to connect the board to a stable 3.3V supply, unstable supplies may cause the flash to fail**

Connect the 1TX pin to the RX pin on your flasher and connect the 1RX pin to the TX pin on your flasher.
Use the ltchiptool to take a backup and flash the board with a new firmware
The tool should automatically detect what port the flasher is on

#### To take a backup

If you are not using the GUI tool take a backup using

```bash
ltchiptool flash <command> <boardfamily> <backupname>
```

#### To flash the chip

Create an empty configuration with the yaml below
Download the compiled firmware file
If you are not using the GUI tool flash the chip using

```bash
ltchiptool flash <command> <firmwarefile>
```

### Remote Receiver

In case you want to use the remote that comes with this device i have dumped all the ir codes and turned them into yaml
Note: I have tried to match some of the functionality, but not everything can be replicated in ESPHome, in these cases i left the actions empty.
