## General Notes

Mill panel heaters are available in various versions. This component is specifically designed for <strong>Generation 2 panel heaters</strong> (not compatible with portable heater models).
If you have a Generation 3 panel heater (which comes with a built-in ESP32), check out this component: Mill Heater ESP32 Component. https://github.com/ssieb/esphome_components/tree/mill/components/mill_heater

To use this component with a Generation 2 panel heater, youâ€™ll need to replace the HF-LPT120A module with an ESP8266
![Desolder](./desolder.jpg "Desolder the LPT120A chip")

HF-LPT120A desoldered
![Removed](./removed.jpg "Removed the LPT120A chip")

Solder the ESP8266 in place.
Refer to the <strong>GPIO Pinout section</strong> for detailed instructions

## GPIO Pinout

| PIN (mill board) | ESP8266    | Description              |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| +3.3V            | VCC        | Power input (3.3V)       |
| GND              | GND        | Ground                   |
| WTX              | TX (GPIO1) | UART transmitter         |
| WRX              | RX (GPIO3) | UART receiver            |
