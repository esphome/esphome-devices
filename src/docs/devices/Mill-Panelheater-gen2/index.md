## General Notes

Mill panel heaters are available in various versions. This component is specifically designed for **Generation 2 panel heaters** (not compatible with portable heater models). Have a look here to check which generation you have https://millheat.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000252071-Which-generation-do-I-have.
If you have a Generation 3 panel heater (which comes with a built-in ESP32), check out this component: https://github.com/ssieb/esphome_components/tree/mill/components/mill_heater

To use this component with a Generation 2 panel heater, youâ€™ll need to replace the HF-LPT120A module with an ESP8266.
