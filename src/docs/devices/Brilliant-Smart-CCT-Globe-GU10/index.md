## Basic Configuration

Notes on the configuration code:

- Best to use static IP address to ensure that the globe reconnects to the Home Assistant API quickly at power up
- Customise the `substitutions` to suit your specific needs (names, IP addresses)
- Use ESPHome secrets for passwords
- If the brightness is set too low, the globe will go out. Looking into a solution for this
- Colour temperatures in code are a guess
