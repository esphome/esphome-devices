## Description

ESP-FBot is an ESPHome custom component for locally monitoring and controlling portable power stations via Bluetooth.
It provides fast local management without cloud services, making it ideal for outage situations.

Compatible with battery systems that use the "BrightEMS" application, including:

- **FOSSiBOT**: F3600 Pro, F2400
- **SYDPOWER**: N052, N066
- **AFERIY**: P210 (2400W/2048Wh), P310 (3300W/3840Wh)

The ESP32 device communicates with the battery using Bluetooth and relays data locally via WiFi to Home Assistant.

## Features

- **Battery Monitoring**: Real-time battery state of charge (%), remaining capacity (kWh), and time remaining
- **Power Monitoring**: Track input power, output power, system consumption, and total power flow
- **Output Control**: Switch USB ports, DC outputs, AC inverter, and light on/off
- **Home Assistant Integration**: All sensors and controls automatically discovered in Home Assistant
- **Auto-reconnect**: Handles BLE disconnections and automatically reconnects

## Requirements

- A compatible battery that uses the "BrightEMS" application (no cloud pairing needed)
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/)
- ESP32 device (M5Stack ATOM Light, M5StickC PLUS2, ESP32-WROOM, ESP32-DevKit, etc.)
- The ESP32 device must be within Bluetooth range of the battery (typically 10-30 feet)

## Getting Started

### 1. Get the Battery's MAC Address

Find the Bluetooth LE MAC address of your battery by searching for a device that starts with "FOSSIBOT" or "POWER".

**On Windows**: Use [BluetoothLEView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/bluetooth_low_energy_scanner.html)

The MAC address will look like `A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6`.

### 2. Installation

1. Use the example configuration below as a starting point
2. Update WiFi credentials, API encryption key, and Battery MAC address
3. Flash to your ESP32 device

## Battery Factory Reset

To remove your battery's WiFi connection to the cloud, you can perform a factory reset. Press and hold the **DC button**, **light button**, and **USB button** simultaneously for about 5 seconds until you hear a beep.
