The Tuya RGBW controller is inexpensive, available on ebay, and can be
OTA flashed using
[tuya-convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert), after
which it can be OTA flashed via the ESPHome web interface (NOTE: a port
must be explicitly set if using a Home Assistant add-on for this, and
you need to connect directly to that port instead of using the proxied
port via Home Assistant).

The configuration below shows an example that can be compiled to a
binary firmware file that works correctly for this device, and that
cycles through three different brightnesses and an off state based on
the number of button presses. The device can also be controlled via Home
Assistant, of course, setting specific RGBW combinations and brightness
levels.
