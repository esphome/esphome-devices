## General Notes

The Air Quality Monitor Kit is designed to provide real-time data on air quality, utilizing the Seeed Xiao ESP32-C3 and the PMS7003 particulate matter sensor. This kit is ideal for environmental monitoring with high accuracy and low power consumption. Features:

- Utilizes Seeed Xiao ESP32-C3.
- Measures PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.
- Includes WS2812B LED on GPIO20.
- Serial communication via UART.
