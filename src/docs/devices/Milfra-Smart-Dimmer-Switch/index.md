## Overall description

Milfra dimmers are another type of in-wall, brightness-only light dimming devices with Tuya-Smart application support,
and support 3+ way installations.

## Technical details

The device is using Tuya-compatible application structure with two main components:

- application-specific MCU, responsible for controlling light output, and
- a Tuya CBU module that contains application level logic.
  - external switch input GPIO is connected to secondary MCU,
  - communication to dimming MCU is bidirectional, currently haven't determined what data the MCU is requesting from Tuya that causes an
    unknown command 0x34 error

## Programming

First programming was done over USB-serial. The module needs disassembled (pretty easy) and moderate soldering
skills are required to attach USB-RS232 converter cables. Did not test if CloudCutter or other methods would work.

Need to solder cables Rx, Tx, Gnd, Vcc (3V3) and CEN pin.
Preferred flashing software is [ltchiptool](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ltchiptool) from LibreTiny project. Start programming like:

```bash
ltchiptool flash write <firmware.uf2>
```

then short CEN pin to ground for a moment to initiate progrmming mode on the module.
