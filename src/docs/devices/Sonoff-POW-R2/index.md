## GPIO Pinout

| Pin    | Function                           |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| GPIO0  | Push Button (HIGH = off, LOW = on) |
| GPIO12 | Relay and its status LED           |
| GPIO13 | Blue LED (HIGH = off, LOW = on)    |
| GPIO1  | RX pin (for serial programming)    |
| GPIO3  | TX pin (for serial programming)    |

## Basic Configuration

As the only controllable LED is the Blue LED, it is configured here to use the
[`status_led` light component](https://esphome.io/components/light/status_led), which will take
over the LED in the event of a error/warning state, such as when WiFi is disrupted.

# the CSE7766 voltage/current and power sensor is connected to the ESP via the ESP's UART (the
# ESP8266 has only one)
#  - this precludes logging via serial, so disable that
#  - the CSE7766 emits data more frequently than desired (which in turn would be passed on by
#    esphome); use a filter to slow down updates
