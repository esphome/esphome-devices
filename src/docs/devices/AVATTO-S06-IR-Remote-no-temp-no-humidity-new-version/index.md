## General Notes

There's two hardware iterations of this particular IR blaster: [an older version that uses an ESP01 module](/devices/AVATTO-S06-IR-Remote-no-temp-no-humidity), and this newer one that uses a CB3S module (a Beken BK7231N module in the same form factor as the older ESP01). Outwardly, both appear identical.

## GPIO Pinout

| Pin    | Function           |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| GPIO8  | Blue Status LED    |
| GPIO26 | Remote Transmitter |
| GPIO7  | Remote Receiver    |
| GPIO6  | Reset Button       |

## Flashing

The device is vulnerable to `tuya-cloudcutter`, and likely `tuya-convert` as well. I flashed mine with ESPHome Kickstart using Cloudcutter, then uploaded an ESPHome UF2 binary from there.

[According to documentation on Elektroda](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3961676.html), you can also use tools such as `ltchiptool` to flash this via serial. There are UART pads labeled on the board and easily accessible. The chip operates at 3.3v.

## Configuration

Some sections containing default ESPHome configuration have been removed from here. Make sure they're filled out in your config.

```yaml
esphome:
  name: s06_ir_blaster
  friendly_name: S06 IR Blaster

bk72xx:
  board: cb3s

logger:

api:

ota:

wifi:

captive_portal:

light:
  - platform: status_led
    name: "Status LED"
    pin: GPIO8

binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    pin:
      number: 6
      inverted: true
      mode:
        input: true
        pullup: true
    name: "Button"

remote_transmitter:
  pin: GPIO26
  carrier_duty_percent: 50%
  
remote_receiver:
  pin:
    number: GPIO7
    inverted: true
    mode:
      input: true
      pullup: true
```

If you're attempting to use this with raw IR commands with an integration such as SmartIR, make sure that you set the carrier frequency accordingly. Not setting this may result in otherwise valid codes not working with your device as anticipated or at all. Valid frequencies typically range betweeen 33-40 kHz or 50-60 kHz, with the most common protocol, the NEC protocol, using a frequency of 38 kHz.

```yaml
api:
  encryption:
    key: "xxxxxxx"
  services:
    - service: send_raw_command
      variables:
        command: int[]
      then:
        - remote_transmitter.transmit_raw:
            code: !lambda "return command;"
            carrier_frequency: !lambda "return 38000.0;"
```

If you don't know the carrier frequency, and the NEC default of 38 kHz doesn't work, you can find out what your device's frequency is by dumping a code from your existing remote. First, modify the `remote_receiver` definition in the ESPHome configuration to dump the codes in Pronto form. These include the carrier frequency embedded in them.

```yaml
remote_receiver:
  pin:
    number: GPIO7
    inverted: true
    mode:
      input: true
      pullup: true
  dump: pronto
```

Once you flash the firmware, keep the device logs open within ESPHome Device Builder. Take the remote for your device, point it at the IR blaster, and press any button to send a command. You should see a code printed out in the device logs. This may be spread across multiple lines depending on length; combine all lines into one.

Next, [open up an IR code converter such as the Sensus IR/RF Code Converter](https://pasthev.github.io/sensus/). Paste the Pronto code into the box labeled "Pronto data" and hit Convert; this may take a few moments to analyze. Once done, the Hz box on the left should be filled with a number. This is your carrier frequency.

Go back to the ESPHome device configuration, remove the `dump: pronto` line, and under the `transmit_raw` services section replace `38000.0` with the value you retrieved. If you are controlling multiple devices that require different carrier frequencies, as might be the case within SmartIR, duplicate the `send_raw_command` service in its entirety, rename it to indicate it's not the 38 kHz frequency command, and replace the carrier frequency in the lambda appropriately.
