The Aspen ASP-200 Smart Window Fan is a Tuya-based device with a WR1 module (which uses a RTL8710BN chip). The WR1 must be removed and replaced with a ESPHome-compatible chip. Features of the fan include intake/exhaust/circulate modes, three speeds, built-in temperature sensor, and removable grills and blades for easy cleaning.

But, there's a catch. The WR1 module has a 1.5mm pin pitch, compared to the 2.0mm pitch of the ESP-12 modules. I recommend using an ESP-12L, as it has the necessary pins pulled up internally, so it only requires connecting VCC, GND, TX, and RX from the ESP-12L to the PCB.

You will have to get creative when connecting the new board to the main PCB. I ended up hot-gluing the ESP-12L module to the WR1 footprint upside down, then using some short lengths of 23ga solid wire from some scrap CAT-6 cable to connect the ESP's pins to the original pads on the WR1 footprint - be very careful if you try using the original pads, as they are very easy to lift off.
