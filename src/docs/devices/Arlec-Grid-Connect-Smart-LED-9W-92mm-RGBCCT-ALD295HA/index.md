Sold at Bunnings in Australia as [Model number ALD295HA](https://www.bunnings.com.au/arlec-9w-92mm-grid-connect-smart-rgb-cct-led-downlight_p0549111).

This device uses a CB2S module (BK7231N MCU) + BP5768 10 Pin LED Driver, and can be flashed with the `kickstart-bk7231n.uf2` [Kickstart](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/esphome-kickstart) firmware using [ltchiptool](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ltchiptool).

## Tuya Cloudcutter / Tuya Convert

The board cannot be flashed using Tuya Cloudcutter (Running Tuya version 1.5.40). I haven't tried Tuya Convert.

## Access

Ensure device is not plugged in.
This device can be accessed easily enough with a suction cup and a Phillips head screwdriver:

- Using a suction cup on the front diffuser, pop out the front diffuser, remove that and the cardboard reflector.
- Undo the 2 Phillips head screws and remove the back cover.
- Carefully remove the Control PCB from the LED PCB (6 Pin Connector).
- Once board has been removed, the TX/RX pins can be accessed for flashing.

## Flashing

I have had best success flashing these Tuya chips  with the ESP Test Rack Module Programmer.
Solder connections to 3V3, GND, TX, RX and connect to module programmer of choice. additional GND required to touch CEN during start of flashing process.

| CB2S     | Programmer                |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| 3V3      | 3V3                       |
| GND      | GND                       |
| RX1      | TX (Maybe marked RX)      |
| TX1      | RX (Maybe marked TX)      |
| CEN      | Touch GND @ Flash Start   |
