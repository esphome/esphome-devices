## Hardware Versions

There are currently 3 known hardware versions of the Shelly Plus 2PM. The pinout is incompatible between PCB version 0.1.5 and 0.1.9.

- PCB v0.1.5 with ESP32-U4WDH (Single core, 160MHz, 4MB embedded flash) Sold pre 2022
- PCB v0.1.9 with ESP32-U4WDH (Single core, 160MHz, 4MB embedded flash) Sold first half of 2022
- PCB v0.1.9 with ESP32-U4WDH (Dual core,   240MHz, 4MB embedded flash) Sold since 2022-09-20 (or earlier)

4 units bought directly from Shelly 2022-09-20 were confirmed to be PCB v0.1.9 with 3 units being dual core ESP32-U4WDH, the last a single core.
The advantage of the dual core version is that it supports the arduino framework.

3 units bought from a reseller in Austria in 2024 were (without opening and checking the PCB) assumed to be PCB v0.1.9 and dual core ESP32-U4WDH. No problems were faced with this assumption.

The single core version of the ESP32-U4WDH will probably be discontinued according to [Espressif PCN](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/pcn_downloads/PCN-2021-021%20ESP32-U4WDH%20%E5%8D%87%E7%BA%A7%E4%B8%BA%E5%8F%8C%E6%A0%B8%E5%A4%84%E7%90%86%E5%99%A8%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81.pdf)

The PCB version number is printed on the back of the PCB.
![Shelly Plus 2PM PCB Versions](shellyplus2pm_pcb_versions.png "Shelly Plus 2PM PCB Versions")

The version of the ESP32-U4WDH can be determined by looking at the second to last line printed on the chip. If the line contains 8 characters starting with "H", the chip is single core 160MHz. If the line contains 9 characters starting with "DH", the chip is a dual core 240MHz.

## Internal Temperature Sensor

An internal NTC temperature sensor in a "DOWNSTREAM" configuration is fitted ([ESPHome reference](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/resistance.html)). Both R1 and R2 has been desoldered and found to be 10k fixed resistor and 10k@25C NTC. The Beta constant of the NTC cannot easily be measured, and is guessed to be ~3350.

## Minimal configuration for PCB v0.1.9 and Dual Core

Minimal configuration with all inputs/outputs and sensors configured

Note that in this example, the relay numbering is swapped compared to the above pinout and the inverter filter is only applied to one of the two power channels. This example would be wrong with the bought Shellys in Austria in 2024.

## Example snippet for Single Core

Shows which settings under esphome and esp32 need to be changed to support the single core 160MHz version of the chip

Note that single core chips are only supported by the esp-idf framework, not arduino. This means that for instance captive portal (required for fallback AP to work) cannot be used.

```yaml

```

## Advanced Configuration Example for PCB v0.1.9 and Dual Core

- Detached switch mode and toggle light switch
- Includes overpower and overtemperature protection.
- Will toggle a smart bulb in home assistant and has fallback to local power switching when connecion to home assitant is down.

Note that in this example, the two power channels are swapped and the inverter filter is only applied to one of the two power channels. This example would be wrong with the bought Shellys in Austria in 2024.

## Current Based Cover Configuration Example for PCB v0.1.9 and Dual Core

To use the Shelly Plus 2PM to control a window cover with an "opening" and a "closing" motor, the [Current Based Cover](https://esphome.io/components/cover/current_based) is used.

This configuration was implemented and tested on three pieces bought in Austria in 2024. As opposed to the examples above, power channel A is for relay 1 (for the "opening" motor), power channel B is for relay 2 (for the "closing" motor), and both power channels need to be inverted in order for the measurement to represent the motors' power consumptions positively.

- outputs are configured to be mutually exclusive (never put power on both the opening and the closing motor)
- the input channels (one for "opening", one for "closing") are used for manual overriding. They always have precedence if used.
- whether or not the manual override is active is exposed as a binary sensor.

```yaml

  devicename: "shelly-plus-2pm"

  max_temp: "80.0"
