## General Notes

The Renke RS-FSJT-N01 Wind speed anemometer is sold in four versions:

- RS485 digital ModBUS output
- 0-5V analog voltage output
- 0-10V analog voltage output
- 4-20mA analog current output

Parameters:

- Measurement range: 0~30m/s, resolution 0.1m/s, accuracy Â± 0.3m/s
- Starting wind speed: 0.5m/s
- DC power supply: 10~30V DC

Configuration presented here is for the RS485 digital ModBUS version.

### Wiring

The cable coming out through the bottom of the unit has the folling pinout:

- Brown: positive power supply
- Black: negative power supply and GND
- Green: RS485-A
- Blue:  RS485-B

### ModBUS Parameters

Wire up a an RS485 transceiver to an ESP32 to interface with the device using ESPHome's [Modbus Component](https://esphome.io/components/modbus.html).

Connection parameters:

- Baud Rate: `4800` (default), supports `2400` and `9600`
- Data bit length: `8`
- Parity check: `None`
- Stop bit: `1`
- Device address: `1`
- Register address for speed value: `0`
- Register data type: `U_WORD`, multiplied by `10`

## Basic Configuration

Slow winds blow in small bursts, so it's recommended to average measurements to have a better overview of the wind condition. That's why we're reading out the measurement every second, and apply a filter to the sensor, taking the maximum blow speed of 5 measurements, averaging them every minute:

```yaml
uart:
  rx_pin: GPIOXX
  tx_pin: GPIOXX
  baud_rate: 4800

modbus:
  id: modbus1

modbus_controller:
  - id: wind_speed_meter
    address: 1
    modbus_id: modbus1
    setup_priority: -10
    command_throttle: 200ms
    update_interval: 1s

sensor:
  - platform: modbus_controller
    modbus_controller_id: wind_speed_meter
    name: "Wind speed"
    device_class: wind_speed
    register_type: read
    address: 0
    unit_of_measurement: "m/s"
    value_type: U_WORD
    accuracy_decimals: 1
    filters:
      - multiply: 0.1
      - max:
          window_size: 5
          send_every: 5
      - exponential_moving_average:
          alpha: 0.1
          send_every: 12
```

Note that the sensor is by default set to ModBUS address `1`, so out of the box it's not possible to connect it together with another one (like a **RS-FXJT-N01** wind direction sensor) to the same ESP UART.

The manufacturer offers a helper application for Windows, called *485 Parameter Configuration Tool*. The sensor can be connected to the PC with a USB-to-RS485 adapter, and the configuration tool makes it easily possible to change the modbus address to something else, eg. `2` (just type it in the *Addr* box and press *Setup* button).

After that it becomes possible to simply connect the sensors in parrallel on the same cable, to a single RS485-TTL transceiver attached to a single UART on the ESP (you need to change the `address` value in the corresponding `modbus_controller` entry in the config).
