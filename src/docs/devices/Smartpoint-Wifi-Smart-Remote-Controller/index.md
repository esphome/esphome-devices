## Flashing

A note about flashing this device:

- On older models of this device, [tuya-convert](https://www.esphome-devices.com/guides/tuya-convert/) should be able to flash this device, but I am unsure how old the device needs to be for this method to still work.
- On newer patched devices (likely yours), [tuya-convert](https://www.esphome-devices.com/guides/tuya-convert/) will not work. In order to flash, gain access to the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) board by prying off the top of the device and unscrewing the PCB from the plastic housing. On the underside of the PCB, the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) board will reveal itself.
