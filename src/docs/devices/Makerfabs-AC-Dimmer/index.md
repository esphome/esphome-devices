## Product description

The Makerfabs Home Assistant AC Dimmer uses a chopper circuit built around a BT139 TRIAC and a zero-cross
detection circuit. It detects each zero-crossing and then controls the TRIAC to chop the AC waveform for dimming.
In addition, because a TRIAC cannot fully disconnect the AC on its own, a relay is included to provide complete on/off
isolation.

- On board AC-DC, No external power supply needed;

- On Board Relay to totally shut down current leakage;

- ESP32 for Home assistant/ ESPhone;

- STM32G030F6P6 , for AC choppping;

- Suitable for AC 110V~230V, Any frequency;

- Max Load: 2KW;

It can be purchased from [Makerfabs](https://www.makerfabs.com/ac-dimmer-for-home-assistant.html).
