date-published: 2024-12-17

This is a Tuya siren with temperature and humidity sensor. Runs on USB and two CR123A batteries as backup (not supplied with the device).
Hardware Versions

There are, so far, three known hardware versions. The console will show one of these MCU Product ID’s: {"p":"ymf4oruxqx0xlogp","v":"1.0.0","m":0}, {"p":"ymf4oruxqx0xlogp","v":"1.0.1","m":0} , {"p":"ymf4oruxqx0xlogp","v":"1.0.2","m":0}, {“p”:”ymf4oruxqx0xlogp”,”v”:”1.0.3”,”m”:0} or {"p":"9fngbrgje6ljqhee","v":"1.0.2","m":0}

The ymf versions work with tuya-convert but the 9fn version requires flashing the device with serial.

The 1.0.1 version supports the TuyaSend0 command to query the MCU for the latest values but the 1.0.2 version does not appear to support that command at this time (2021-03-05).

In an order on 2021-01-31 for three devices, one of each hardware versions was received. In an order from 2020-12, the 1.0.1 version was received, which is rock solid.
