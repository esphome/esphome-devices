<h1>ESPHome Device Configuration Repository</h1>

<p>
  This website is a repository of device configuration templates and setup
  guides for devices running <a href="https://esphome.io">ESPHome</a> firmware.
</p>

<p>
  The goal is to document all devices capable of running the firmware along with
  a basic configuration yaml that can be easily copied and uploaded which
  restores the device back to its original functionality. Additionaly, more
  advanced configuration of devices could also be documented.
