# Docusaurus App

- This is a Docusaurus react app, written in Typescript using pnpm package manager.
- Try to reuse existing state instead of creating new state
- Check for existing components before suggesting new ones
- Ensure react code is performance optimized: Use useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo where needed.
- Ensure minimal re-renders: Suggest best state management practices, as much as possible stay away from external libraries. Let's prioritize React's native state management capabilities.
