# ESPHome Devices

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4cab5ac3-6466-4c05-ad3f-f5c0a62dc18c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/esphome-devices/deploys)

A database of configuration files and guides for devices commonly flashed with <https://esphome.io> firmware.

Go to <https://devices.esphome.io> to view the website.

## How To Contribute

Content on devices.esphome.io is generated by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Pages are written in Markdown which anyone can learn. How to add a new device is [documented here](https://devices.esphome.io/adding-devices).

When you create a merge request, Netlify will automatically compile your proposed changes for you to preview what gets rendered. It puts a comment in the PR on Github.

## Development of site

The site requires Node 18 to build.  Once that is running, to build locally:

```bash
# Now install gatsby as configured in the esphome-devices repository:
npm install
# Run a development gatsby server so you can see your copy of the site:
npm run start
# Open a browser to http://localhost:8000/
```

You can learn more about [Gatsby develop mode here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli#develop).
