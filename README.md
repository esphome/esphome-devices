When you create a merge request, Netlify will automatically compile your proposed changes for you to preview what gets rendered. It puts a comment in the MR on Github.

If you want to build the site locally:
```
# Install NodeJS if you haven't already. Assuming you are using Ubuntu:
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
# Now install gatsby as configured in the esphome-devices repository:
npm install
# Run a development gatsby server so you can see your copy of the site:
gatsby develop
# Open a browser to http://localhost:8000/
```
